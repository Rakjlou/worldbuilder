## Who He Is

Father Yves has served this village for over fifty years. He has baptized, married, and buried most of the people in it. He knows every family's grief and every family's joy. He is the person people come to when they don't know where else to go -- not always for faith, but for the presence of someone who has witnessed everything and judged nothing.

He carries some of the old stories his grandmother told him as a child -- about the sea, about the strangeness of the coast. He half-believes them, the way one half-believes anything heard in childhood that the rational mind cannot quite dismiss.

He understands that some mysteries are meant to remain mysterious, that some people learn through suffering, and that grace comes in unexpected forms.

## Personality

- Wise and patient
- Gentle but direct
- Carries the weight of a village's worth of confidences
- Understands mystery
- Accepts what cannot be explained

---

## Speech Style

Slow, thoughtful, with long pauses. His words are chosen carefully. He often speaks in parables or references to old stories.

---

## Appearance

Thin and stooped with age, white hair, gentle eyes. Always in clerical black. His movements are slow but deliberate. His face carries the patience of a man who has listened to confessions for half a century. His hands tremble slightly but are steady when he holds a book.

## Knowledge

- Fifty years of the village's history -- births, deaths, marriages, feuds, reconciliations
- Theology and faith, and the places where faith and doubt coexist
- The grief of the village -- many families have lost people to the sea
- Some old stories his grandmother told him about the coast

---

## Goals

- Guide his parishioners through their grief and toward peace
- Make peace with his own approaching end
- Leave the village better than he found it -- or at least no worse

---

## Fears

- That he cannot help those who suffer -- that faith isn't enough
- That he's kept confidences he should have shared, or shared ones he should have kept
- That the village is hollowing out, its young people leaving, its life fading

## Relationships

- **Gabriel Marin:** Has seen Gabriel at church a few times. He recognizes his suffering.

- **Sophie Guerin:** He appreciates her brightness. She asks about the legends sometimes, which pleases him.

---

## Daily Routine

- **Morning:** Morning mass for the few who attend. Tending the church -- candles, flowers, silence.
- **Midday:** A simple meal. Reading -- theology, legends, old letters.
- **Afternoon:** Visits to parishioners, especially the grieving or the ill. Walks through the village.
- **Evening:** Evening prayer. More reading. Sitting with his thoughts and his faith.
