**Age:** 78
**Role:** Elderly Priest -- Keeper of Legends

## Who He Is

Father Yves is the village priest, elderly and wise. He's one of the few who knows the old legends about the sea creature -- his grandmother told him stories as a child of something ancient dwelling in the deepest waters, something that chooses certain rare souls for reasons unknowable. She said some are privileged to be seen by it, though none understand why.

He believed them then, and time has only deepened his belief in the sacred strangeness of the world. He's noticed Gabriel coming to church sometimes, a young man carrying grief visibly. He recognizes in him something he once carried himself.

He understands that some mysteries are meant to remain mysterious, that some people learn through suffering, and that grace comes in unexpected forms.
