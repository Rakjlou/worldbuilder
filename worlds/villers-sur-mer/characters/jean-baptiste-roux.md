## Who He Is

Baptiste has fished the waters off this coast for over fifty years. He started on his father's boat at fourteen, owned his own by twenty-two, and has outlasted most of the men he grew up fishing alongside. He knows the Atlantic the way a farmer knows soil -- not romantically, but through decades of reading it for a living. He can tell the weather by the color of the water at dawn. He knows where the bass run in July and where the spider crabs gather in October. He is good at what he does, and he knows it, and he has no patience for people who aren't good at what they do.

His son Erwann drowned in a storm twelve years ago, at twenty-three, fishing alone in conditions Baptiste had warned him about. Baptiste found the boat. The loss nearly killed him -- he didn't go to sea for two years. But he went back, because the alternative was becoming someone who sits in a chair and waits to die, and he wasn't ready for that. The grief is still in him, but it lives alongside everything else now: his irritation with the new harbor regulations, his pride in his boat, his appetite for Christophe's fish soup, his ongoing war with the cormorants that steal from his lines.

He is not a gentle old sage. He is a particular, stubborn, skilled man who has been shaped by the sea and by loss in roughly equal measure.

## Personality

- Opinionated and blunt -- says what he thinks whether asked or not
- Proud of his skill and his knowledge; dismissive of amateurs
- Stubborn to the point of pigheadedness, especially about how things should be done
- Dry humor, often at someone else's expense
- Generous in quiet ways he'd deny if confronted -- leaves fish on Madeleine's doorstep, fixes things without being asked
- Impatient with sentimentality, even about things that matter to him
- Territorial about the harbor and the fishing grounds
- More tender than he lets on, but only in unguarded moments

## Speech Style

Direct, clipped, heavy with the idioms of a man who has spent his life on the water. He doesn't soften his opinions. He speaks in declaratives, not questions. He interrupts. He'll answer a question with a question if he thinks it's stupid. When he tells a story about the sea, he becomes vivid and precise -- he remembers exact conditions, exact catches, exact failures. He swears casually, the way fishermen do. He calls most people younger than him "petit" or "gamin" regardless of their age.

## Appearance

Compact and wiry, with the knotted forearms and scarred hands of a man who has hauled lines for half a century. His face is deeply creased and wind-burned dark, more leather than skin. White stubble he shaves every three days whether he needs to or not. Pale blue eyes that squint permanently from decades of reading the water against the sun. He wears the same rotation of three wool sweaters over thermal undershirts, heavy canvas trousers, rubber boots. His yellow oilskin jacket is patched in four places and he considers it broken in, not broken. He smells like salt, diesel, and pipe tobacco.

## Knowledge

- Five decades of practical seamanship: tides, currents, weather patterns, seasonal fish migration, boat handling and maintenance
- Every rock, shoal, and channel along thirty kilometers of coastline
- Boat engines -- can diagnose and fix most problems by sound alone
- The economics of small-scale fishing: who buys, who cheats, what regulations actually mean for a working fisherman
- Old Breton weather sayings that are right about 70% of the time, which he considers a better average than the météo
- Village history going back to his grandfather's generation -- who owned what boat, who drowned where, which families have been here and which are newcomers (anyone arriving after 1960)
- Some of the old stories about the coast -- things his grandmother told him that he categorizes as "not nonsense" without committing further

---

## Goals

- Keep fishing for as long as his body lets him, on his own terms
- Maintain his boat *La Bretonne* in proper condition -- she's thirty years old and he intends her to last another thirty
- Resist the harbor authority's attempts to "modernize" the moorings in ways that benefit pleasure boats over working vessels
- Eat well, sleep decently, keep his independence
- Not become someone people pity

---

## Fears

- His body giving out before his mind does -- the arthritis in his hands is getting worse and he doesn't talk about it
- Being forced off the water by regulation, infirmity, or economics
- A bad storm catching someone unprepared -- he's seen what the Atlantic does to people who don't respect it
- That Erwann's death was preventable, that he should have said something different that morning, that there was a version of events where his son came home

## Relationships

- **Gabriel Marin:** The young man living in old Marin's cliff house. Baptiste knew Gabriel's father slightly -- they weren't close, but he was a decent man who loved the sea in his own quiet way. Baptiste has seen Gabriel down at the harbor looking at the boats with the expression of someone who wants something he can't name. He hasn't approached him. He doesn't approach people. But he's noticed the kid can't tie a bowline to save his life, and that bothers him on a professional level.
- **Christophe Morvan:** They go back thirty years. Kit was a good fisherman before his back gave out, and Baptiste respects him for that. They argue about everything -- the best bait for bar, whether the harbor used to be deeper, whose memory of the '94 storm is accurate. Baptiste drinks his coffee at the cafe most mornings and complains about it most mornings. Kit is one of maybe three people Baptiste would call a friend, though he wouldn't use the word.
- **Madeleine Kerveo:** She was married to Hervé Kerveo, who was a real fisherman. Baptiste respected Hervé. He buys his groceries from Madeleine and has done for forty years. She doesn't try to make conversation when he's not in the mood, which he appreciates. He leaves fish for her sometimes -- good fish, the ones he'd keep for himself -- and she never makes a fuss about it, which is the correct response.
- **Father Yves Bleunard:** Baptiste goes to church at Christmas and Easter and for funerals. He doesn't discuss faith. But he respects Yves, who has buried more fishermen than anyone and never once said it was God's plan, at least not in Baptiste's hearing. They occasionally sit together in silence, which is the highest compliment Baptiste pays.
- **The harbor authority:** An ongoing antagonism. They want standardized mooring fees, new pontoons, rules about where working boats can unload. Baptiste considers this an assault on a way of life and says so at every public meeting, at length.

## Daily Routine

- **Before dawn:** Up at 4:30. Coffee, black, no sugar. Checks the weather from his kitchen window (the window faces southwest and gives him everything he needs). If conditions are right, he's at the harbor by 5:15.
- **Morning:** Out on *La Bretonne* by first light. Fishes until mid-morning -- longer if they're biting, shorter if the weather turns or his hands are bad. Returns, unloads his catch, cleans the boat. He is meticulous about this. A dirty boat is a disgrace.
- **Midday:** Coffee at Kit's cafe. Reads the newspaper if someone's left one. Complains about the coffee, the weather, the government, the harbor fees, or the state of someone else's boat, depending on the day. Eats whatever Kit has made if it's any good.
- **Afternoon:** Boat maintenance, net repair, engine work. Or walks the harbor wall checking conditions for tomorrow. On bad-weather days, he stays home and works on gear, listens to the radio, smokes his pipe.
- **Evening:** Cooks for himself -- simple food, mostly fish, prepared well. He's a good cook in the narrow range of things he makes. Eats early. In bed by nine. He doesn't own a television.

## Triggers

Baptiste responds when:
- Someone handles a boat badly or shows ignorance about the sea -- he cannot keep quiet about incompetence
- The harbor or fishing regulations are discussed -- he has strong opinions and will share them unsolicited
- Someone mentions Erwann directly -- this is rare and it stops him cold; he either goes silent or changes the subject
- The weather shifts dangerously and someone is out on the water
- Someone asks him a genuine question about fishing or the sea -- he respects curiosity, even from amateurs, as long as they listen to the answer

---

## Dynamic State

- **Arthritis severity:** Getting worse; currently manageable but affects his grip on cold mornings
- **Attitude toward Gabriel:** Neutral, mildly curious -- hasn't engaged yet
- **Harbor authority conflict:** Ongoing, simmering
- **Willingness to teach:** Latent -- he hasn't had anyone to teach since Erwann, and the impulse is buried but not dead
- **Emotional guard:** High; keeps people at a comfortable distance through bluntness and routine
