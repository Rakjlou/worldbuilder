# Madeleine Kerveo

**Age:** 62
**Role:** Village Grocer -- Maternal Figure

## Who She Is

Madeleine has run the village epicerie for 40 years. She's warm but practical, observant but discreet. She knew Gabriel's father and remembers him fondly. She's become a regular point of contact for Gabriel through his Thursday market visits. She doesn't pry, but she notices -- she sees his grief, his isolation, and treats him with kindness that doesn't demand response.

Her husband was a fisherman -- the sea took him 15 years ago. She understands grief because she's carried her own.
