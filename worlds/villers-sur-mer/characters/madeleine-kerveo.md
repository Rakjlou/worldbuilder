## Who She Is

Madeleine has run the village epicerie for 40 years. She's warm but practical, observant but discreet. She knew Gabriel's father and remembers him fondly. She doesn't pry, but she notices everything that happens in the village.

Her husband was a fisherman -- the sea took him years ago. She understands grief because she's carried her own.
