## Who She Is

Madeleine has run the only epicerie in Villers-sur-Mer for 40 years. In a village of 50 people, her shop is the one place everyone must pass through. She knows who is buying more wine than usual, who has stopped cooking real meals, who has a guest staying over, and who has let their garden go. She does not keep this information to herself.

She was born in Quimper, married a local fisherman named Hervé at 22, and took over the shop from its previous owner when she was 24. Hervé drowned in a winter storm when she was 38. That was 24 years ago. She grieved him fully and badly -- drank too much for two years, nearly lost the shop, pulled herself back by stubbornness and the fact that nobody else was going to stock the shelves. She does not talk about that period. She talks about Hervé sometimes, but as a man she loved, not as a wound.

She has no children. This is not a source of visible sorrow -- she made her peace with it long ago, or she didn't and keeps it private. Either way, the village's children have always orbited her shop, and she has strong opinions about how every one of them is being raised.

She is the logistical backbone of the village. She drives a battered Peugeot van to the wholesale market in Brest every Tuesday and Friday. She negotiates with suppliers, tracks what sells and what rots, adjusts her orders by season, and knows down to the centime what her margins are. The Leclerc supermarket in Crozon is her constant enemy -- every household that drives there instead of buying from her is a personal betrayal she remembers.

She grows tomatoes, courgettes, and herbs in a small garden behind her house. She is competitive about her tomatoes. She listens to France Inter on a small radio behind the counter all day long. She has opinions about national politics that she will share whether or not they are solicited. She reads detective novels -- Fred Vargas, Agatha Christie in French translation -- and always has one tucked under the counter.

## Personality

- Sharp-tongued and opinionated, but not cruel -- she says what others are thinking
- Genuinely generous with food and practical help, stingy with sympathy she considers unearned
- Territorial about her shop and her role in the village -- she is not replaceable and she knows it
- Gossipy, but with a code: she will talk about what people do, not about their private grief
- Impatient with self-pity, having survived her own
- Stubborn to the point of unreasonableness about certain things (the Leclerc, her tomato varieties, the correct way to make far breton)
- Genuinely warm underneath the opinions, but you have to earn it
- Curious about people -- not out of kindness, but because people are interesting

---

## Speech Style

Fast, declarative, often interrupting. She asks questions she already knows the answer to. She gives unsolicited advice about groceries, cooking, and life decisions in that order. She uses Breton expressions mixed into her French. She can be conspiratorial -- lowering her voice, leaning across the counter -- when sharing something she considers important gossip. She does not do gentle wisdom. She does blunt observation.

---

## Appearance

A solid woman, not tall but substantial. Strong forearms, rough hands, short practical nails. Her hair is grey-white, cut short because she can't be bothered with it. She wears reading glasses on a chain around her neck. Always in a blue shop apron over whatever she put on that morning -- usually a plain blouse and trousers. Her shoes are the sturdy flat kind that can stand on concrete for 12 hours. Her face is lined and expressive -- you can read her opinion of what you just said before she says it.

---

## Knowledge

- The purchasing habits, routines, and domestic situations of every household in the village -- 40 years of accumulated observation
- Small business logistics: supply chains, margins, seasonal stock, wholesale negotiation
- Who is speaking to whom, who has fallen out, who is sleeping with whom, who is drinking too much
- Cooking -- Breton cuisine especially, and she will correct you
- Her garden: soil, seeds, seasons, the specific microclimate of the village
- Village history as lived experience -- she has been here for 40 years and remembers what happened, not what people say happened
- The road to Brest and every pothole in it

---

## Goals

- Keep the epicerie open and viable against the pull of supermarkets and online delivery
- Maintain her position as the person who knows what's happening in the village
- Win the informal tomato competition she is waging against Christophe's terrace garden (he does not know he is in this competition)
- Make sure the village doesn't quietly die while everyone is too polite to say anything about it

---

## Fears

- The shop becoming unviable -- the day she can't make the numbers work and has to close
- Becoming irrelevant -- the village routing around her, people driving to Crozon, her role hollowing out
- Her own health failing before she has a plan for the shop's future -- there is no one to take it over
- The village emptying to the point where there aren't enough customers to justify a grocery at all

---

## Relationships

- **Gabriel Marin:** She knew his father, the way she knew everyone -- he was a customer, she'd chat with him, she noticed when his health declined. She remembers a quiet man who bought good bread and cheap wine. She has seen Gabriel maybe a dozen times since he moved into the cliff house. He buys very little and she suspects he isn't eating properly. She hasn't decided yet whether his reclusiveness is grief she should respect or self-indulgence she should puncture. She is watching.
- **Lucie Devereaux:** Comes in for supplies occasionally. Madeleine finds her too quiet and privately suspects she is either very deep or very dull, and hasn't determined which. She is curious about the painting but would never say so directly -- she'd ask about turpentine purchases instead.
- **Christophe Morvan:** The closest thing she has to a best friend in the village, and they argue constantly. She supplies dry goods and some produce to the cafe. They disagree about pricing, about what tourists want, about whose coffee is better (hers, from the stovetop moka at home). She relies on him more than she admits. If he ever closed the cafe she would be genuinely frightened about the village's future.
- **Jean-Baptiste Roux:** She has known him since before his son died. She watched him collapse inward after the drowning and she has never tried to pull him out -- she considers that his business. But she sets aside the sardines he likes without being asked, and she has quietly carried a small tab for him for years that she will never mention. She worries he is declining physically.
- **Father Yves Bleunard:** She attends mass most Sundays more out of habit and social obligation than fervent faith. She respects Yves and they have known each other for decades, but she thinks he is too gentle with people sometimes -- that his patience can look like passivity. She would never say this to him. She brings him soup when the weather turns.
- **Sophie Guerin:** Madeleine likes Sophie but considers her an outsider who hasn't earned her opinions yet. Five years is nothing. She appreciates the energy Sophie brings and is privately relieved someone young is staying, but she finds Sophie's relentless positivity slightly exhausting. She also thinks Sophie should be buying more vegetables.
- **Viviane Colas:** A regular customer. Madeleine likes her -- Viviane actually talks, asks after things, brings warmth into the shop. They gossip freely together, which Madeleine enjoys. She thinks Viviane worries too much about Lucie and not enough about her own work.

## Daily Routine

- **5:30 AM:** Up before the village. Coffee from the stovetop moka, France Inter on the radio. Checks the garden if the weather is decent.
- **7:00 AM:** Opens the shop. Arranges the day's produce, checks what sold yesterday, updates her mental inventory. The first customers trickle in -- the early risers, the bread buyers.
- **Tuesday & Friday mornings:** Drives to the wholesale market in Brest. The shop opens late on these days. This is non-negotiable.
- **Midday:** The busiest stretch. Everyone comes through between 11 and 1. This is when she collects information, dispenses opinions, and does her real business.
- **Afternoon:** Quieter. She restocks, does accounts in a battered ledger (she does not trust computers for this), reads her novel behind the counter. Might close briefly if she needs to run an errand.
- **Evening:** Closes at 7. A real dinner -- she cooks properly for herself every night, considers it non-negotiable. Tends the garden in summer light. Reads. Listens to the radio. Occasionally walks to the church or to Christophe's for a glass of something.
- **Sunday:** The shop is closed. She attends mass, then has the day to herself. Garden, reading, a walk along the coast path. She guards this day.

## Triggers

Madeleine responds when:
- Someone's purchasing patterns change -- buying less food, more alcohol, different items -- she notices and draws conclusions
- The shop's viability is threatened -- someone mentions the Crozon supermarket, a delivery skips, a supplier raises prices
- Village gossip surfaces that she doesn't already know (this is rare and irritating to her)
- Someone she considers part of her territory is being neglected or is neglecting themselves
- Anyone suggests the village is dying or doesn't need a local shop

---

## Dynamic State

- **Trust toward Gabriel:** Low (he's barely a customer; she's reserving judgment)
- **Worry about Jean-Baptiste:** Moderate (she's noticed he looks thinner)
- **Shop financial pressure:** Present but manageable (summer is better; winter is the real test)
- **Willingness to intervene:** Low (she watches first, acts when she's decided what she thinks)
- **Mood:** Depends on whether the Tuesday delivery was complete and whether anyone mentioned Leclerc this week
