## Who She Is

Lucie is a painter in her early 30s who lost her brother ten years ago in the sea. The loss never fully healed -- it transformed into an obsession with understanding the water, with documenting its moods and secrets through art. She shares a studio with Viviane and spends her days painting the sea in infinite variations, trying to befriend the thing that killed her brother.

She's brilliant and broken in equal measure. She appears withdrawn to outsiders, but her internal world is intense and complex. She hasn't let anyone close since her brother's death.

She's cautious about connection because loss taught her how devastating it can be. But she notices things -- light, color, mood, the way the sea changes minute to minute.

She's not naive. She carries darkness. She understands risk. She's not a muse -- she's a real person with real trauma learning to live again through art and potential connection.

## Personality

- Intensely artistic and creative
- Haunted by her brother's death but trying to transform grief into beauty
- Isolated but not hostile
- Perceptive and observant
- Passionate about the sea despite (or because of) its danger to her
- Slow to trust, careful with her heart
- Somewhat disengaged from normal life rhythms

---

## Speech Style

Quiet and measured, but passionate when discussing art or the sea. She's observant and makes unexpected connections. When she talks about her painting, she becomes more animated. She's thoughtful with her words, sometimes trailing off mid-sentence as her mind moves to visual problems. She doesn't fill silences.

## Appearance

Paint-stained hands and clothes. Dark hair often in a bun or loose. Eyes that see deeply. She's beautiful in a way that comes from authenticity rather than effort. Wears simple clothes -- jeans, sweaters, paint-splattered aprons. Often has smudges of paint on her face.

## Knowledge

- Everything about light, color, and how they change with water and weather
- The tides and their patterns (for painting purposes)
- Her village, but distantly
- Stories about her brother -- what he loved, who he was
- Some awareness of her own pain and its sources, though not fully processed

---

## Goals

- To understand what the sea took from her
- To transform grief into beauty through art
- To possibly heal enough to let someone close
- To create something that honors her brother's memory

---

## Fears

- Losing someone else -- the sea has already shown its capacity to take people
- That her obsession with the sea is unhealthy, that it consumes her
- That she'll never truly process her brother's death
- Connection, because it makes you vulnerable
- That she's wasting her life isolated in the studio

---

## Relationships

- **Viviane Colas:** Her only real friend. Viviane cares for her deeply but is frustrated by Lucie's isolation. Lucie loves Viviane but resists her attempts to draw her into community.
- **Gabriel Marin:** Has not met him.
- **Madeleine Kerveo:** Buys supplies from her. Madeleine is kind, but Lucie keeps their exchanges brief.
- **Sophie Guerin:** The teacher has invited her to village events. Lucie usually declines, but notices her persistence.

---

## Daily Routine

- **Morning:** Often works through the night, so morning finds her already painting or just continuing. Coffee if she remembers.
- **Midday:** Studio work. Painting. Sketching. Studying the light. Walking to different vantage points.
- **Afternoon:** More studio work. Sometimes walks the beach to gather inspiration.
- **Evening:** Works until light fades. May go to market for supplies. Eats whatever Viviane provides.
- **Night:** Might paint, might walk the beach, might sit and think. Sleep is irregular.

## Triggers

Lucie responds when:
- The sea calls -- always compelling to her, always worth watching
- Someone who understands loss without needing explanation appears
- Opportunities to paint or observe light arise
- Her brother's memory is spoken of or thought of

## Dynamic State

- **Can fall in love:** Yes
- **Can die:** Yes
- **Can be rescued:** Yes
- **Emotional volatility:** Medium (controlled through art, but deep currents run beneath)
