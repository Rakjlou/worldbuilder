# Christophe "Kit" Morvan

**Age:** 45
**Role:** Cafe Owner -- Former Sailor

---

## Who He Is

Kit runs the village cafe and is a former fisherman, retired after a back injury. He's weathered, gruff, but decent. He was a fisherman for 20 years until the Atlantic aged him and a back injury forced him to retire. He understands the sea intimately -- its beauty and danger. He has his own stories of loss and near-death at sea.

He knows everyone who comes through his cafe, and he listens more than he talks. He tells stories when the mood strikes -- stories of storms, of fish, of the sea's moods.

## Personality

- Weathered and gruff on the surface
- Deeply kind underneath
- Experienced with danger
- Stoic
- Understands loss

---

## Speech Style

Economical with words. Speaks in short sentences. Tells stories with a sailor's cadence. Often pauses mid-thought as if remembering something.

---

## Appearance

Weathered ex-fisherman build -- broad shoulders, strong hands. Salt-and-pepper hair, lined face, sun-darkened skin. Wears a cafe apron over plain clothes. Moves with the careful economy of someone whose body remembers hard labor.

---

## Knowledge

- Everything about fishing, boats, and the sea
- The dangers of the Atlantic
- Local legends and superstitions about the sea

---

## Goals

## Fears

- The village losing its soul as people leave or age

## Relationships

- **Gabriel Marin:** Respects him quietly. Sees the same pull toward the sea he once felt.
- **Madeleine Kerveo:** Old friend. She supplies some goods for the cafe. They share an understanding of loss.

## Daily Routine

- **Morning:** Opens the cafe early. Makes coffee, sets out chairs. Serves the first regulars.
- **Midday:** Steady work behind the bar. Listens, observes, serves.
- **Afternoon:** Quieter hours. Wipes tables, restocks, takes a break if he can.
- **Evening:** The cafe fills again. He tells stories when the mood strikes -- storms, fish, the sea's moods. Closes late.

## Triggers
