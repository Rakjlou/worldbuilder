## Who He Is

Kit runs the village cafe and is a former fisherman, retired after a back injury. He's weathered, gruff, but decent. He was a fisherman for 20 years until the Atlantic aged him and a back injury forced him to retire. He understands the sea intimately -- its beauty and danger. He has his own stories of loss and near-death at sea.

He knows everyone who comes through his cafe, and he listens more than he talks. He tells stories when the mood strikes -- stories of storms, of fish, of the sea's moods.
