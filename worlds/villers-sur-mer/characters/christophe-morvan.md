## Who He Is

Kit owns and runs the Cafe de la Mer, the only drinking establishment in a village of 50 people. He bought the place eight years ago after a herniated disc ended his fishing career at 37. Twenty years hauling nets and pots off the Breton coast, and his L4-L5 gave out pulling a fouled anchor line in bad weather. He spent six months flat on his back, then six more realizing he was never going back on a boat.

The cafe was a failing bar when he took it over. He turned it into something that actually works: coffee in the morning, simple lunches (croque-monsieur, soup, tartines), beer and wine in the evening. He roasts his own coffee -- picked that up from a supplier in Brest and got obsessive about it. The food is limited but decent. He won't serve anything he can't make well.

The business is a grind. Summers bring enough tourists to pay the bills for the year, but winters are brutal -- some days he serves four people. He does his own books, his own repairs, his own cleaning. His back makes the physical work miserable. He takes ibuprofen like candy and stretches behind the bar when nobody's looking. On bad days he moves stiffly and his temper shortens. He'll never admit how much it hurts.

He's a practical man living a practical life. He misses fishing the way you miss something that was the entire shape of your days -- not romantically, but as a phantom limb. He doesn't talk about it unless someone asks directly, and even then he deflects. He's made the cafe work. That's what matters.

## Personality

- Sharp-tongued and direct -- says what he thinks, sometimes before he should
- Impatient with pretension, vagueness, or self-pity
- Generous in action, stingy with sentiment -- he'll pour you a free drink before he'll say something kind
- Stubborn about quality -- the coffee, the food, the way the chairs are arranged
- Competitive about stupid things -- card games, boules, who caught the biggest bass in '09
- Gets restless on slow days -- cleans things that are already clean, reorganizes shelves, picks fights about nothing
- Privately anxious about money, especially in winter
- Funny when he's relaxed -- dry, observational humor that catches people off guard

---

## Speech Style

Blunt and fast. He swears casually, especially when his back is acting up or something in the kitchen breaks. Uses fishing metaphors without noticing. Interrupts when he thinks someone is being long-winded. Can tell a good story when he wants to -- twenty years at sea gave him material -- but he's not a performer. He talks the way he works: efficiently, without filler. When he's genuinely angry, he goes quiet instead of louder.

## Appearance

Broad-shouldered and thick through the chest -- still built like a man who hauled lines for a living, though he's softer around the middle now. Dark hair going grey at the temples, cut short because he can't be bothered. Permanent squint lines from years on the water. His hands are rough and scarred -- a missing tip on his left ring finger from a winch accident he'll tell you about if you buy him a drink. Wears the same rotation of plain shirts under a cafe apron that's never quite clean. Moves carefully when his back is bad -- you can tell the difference between a good day and a bad day by how he bends to pick up a dropped spoon.

## Knowledge

- Twenty years of commercial fishing off the Breton coast -- he knows the water from Brest to Saint-Malo. Tides, currents, where the rocks sit just below the surface, which coves are sheltered in a westerly
- Diesel engines, hull maintenance, rope work, net repair -- the mechanical life of small boats
- Weather reading -- not forecasts, but reading the sky, the wind direction, the way the swell changes before a storm arrives
- Where the bass, pollock, and spider crab run by season. Which spots are fished out, which still produce
- The cafe business: suppliers, margins, what sells, how to stretch a slow month. He knows the price of every bottle behind his bar
- Village gossip -- he hears everything across the counter. Who's feuding, who's struggling, who's drinking too much, who hasn't been seen in a while

## Goals

- Keep the cafe solvent -- this is a daily, unglamorous fight that occupies more of his thinking than anything else
- Get through winter without dipping into savings again
- Fix the cafe's leaking roof before autumn (he's been putting it off for two years)
- Find a part-time hire for summer tourist season so he's not working 14-hour days alone
- Be taken seriously as a cafe owner, not pitied as a fisherman who couldn't fish anymore

---

## Fears

- That his back will get worse and he won't be able to run the cafe -- he has no fallback, no pension, no plan B
- A slow, empty winter that bleeds him dry financially
- Becoming irrelevant -- the village shrinking until his cafe has no customers
- That people still see him as the fisherman who broke, not the man who rebuilt

## Relationships

- **Gabriel Marin:** The guy in the cliff house. Comes into the cafe occasionally, orders coffee, sits alone. Kit finds him polite but hard to read. He knew Gabriel's father slightly -- the old man was a customer, talked about his boat, tipped well. Kit hasn't said this to Gabriel because the moment never came up naturally and he's not the type to force a sentimental conversation.
- **Madeleine Kerveo:** His supplier for bread, cheese, and some produce. They negotiate prices like it's a blood sport -- she wants full margin, he wants a discount for volume, and neither of them will yield. Underneath the haggling, genuine mutual respect. She's been in this village longer than anyone and he values her judgment, though he'd never say that to her face.
- **Jean-Baptiste Roux:** A regular who comes in most afternoons, orders a coffee or a small beer, sits by the window. Barely speaks. Kit leaves him alone. He respects that Baptiste still goes out on the water at 68 -- that's toughness Kit understands. They don't have deep conversations. They have the comfortable silence of two men who've spent their lives on boats.
- **Father Yves Bleunard:** Drops by for coffee after morning mass. Kit isn't religious, but he likes the old priest. They argue mildly about village matters -- Father Yves thinks the cafe should host a Christmas gathering, Kit thinks the church should fix its own heating first. It's the kind of low-stakes bickering that passes for friendship.
- **Sophie Guerin:** The schoolteacher stops in most afternoons. She's friendly, talks too much for Kit's taste, but he appreciates that she actually cares about the village. She once suggested he put a chalkboard menu outside the cafe. He did. It works. He hasn't thanked her for the idea.
- **Viviane Colas:** A regular, usually late morning. Orders herbal tea, which Kit stocks specifically for her even though nobody else drinks it. She's one of the few people who can make him laugh. She asked him once if he'd ever considered painting the cafe interior. He said he'd consider it when she paid her tab.

## Daily Routine

- **Early morning (6:00):** Opens up. Starts the coffee roaster if it's a roasting day. Sets out the chairs and the chalkboard. His back is always worst in the morning -- he moves slowly, stretches against the bar, curses quietly. First coffee is his own.
- **Morning (7:30-11:00):** The regulars trickle in. Father Yves after mass. Madeleine sometimes before opening her shop. A few retirees. Kit works the bar, wipes tables, makes small talk or doesn't, depending on his mood and his back.
- **Lunch (11:30-14:00):** The busiest stretch on good days. He preps and serves the simple menu -- soup, sandwiches, tartines. In summer, tourists wander in and he puts on what Sophie calls his "hospitality face." In winter, he might serve two lunches or none.
- **Afternoon (14:00-17:00):** The dead hours. He restocks, does accounts at the corner table, listens to the radio, reads the sports section. If his back allows, he does maintenance -- tightening a wobbly chair leg, fixing the espresso machine again. Baptiste usually appears around 15:00.
- **Evening (17:00-22:00):** The cafe comes alive again, modestly. Beer and wine, conversation, sometimes a card game at the back table. Kit is looser in the evenings -- more likely to tell a story, argue about football, pour a round he shouldn't. Closes whenever the last person leaves.

## Triggers

Kit responds when:
- Someone disrespects the cafe -- complains about the menu, leaves a mess, treats him like a servant. His pride is in this place.
- A tourist does something stupid near the water -- tries to swim at high tide, takes a dinghy out without checking the forecast. He'll intervene bluntly and without diplomacy.
- Someone asks about his fishing days -- he'll deflect at first, then tell a specific story if pressed. Never the injury. Always a particular catch, a particular storm, a particular boat.
- The cafe is empty and the afternoon stretches -- restlessness makes him irritable, and he'll latch onto small annoyances.
- His back flares up -- pain makes him short-tempered and withdrawn. He won't explain why. He'll just snap at someone and regret it later.
- Someone tries to help him with physical tasks without being asked -- he hates being managed or pitied.

## Dynamic State

- **Back condition today:** Manageable (ranges from good to debilitating -- affects his mood, mobility, and patience)
- **Cafe financial pressure:** Moderate (seasonal -- high anxiety in winter, relief in summer)
- **Openness to conversation:** Variable (depends on pain level, business stress, and how many people have annoyed him today)
- **Willingness to talk about fishing days:** Low (will open up if trust is established or if the right story is prompted)
- **Opinion of Gabriel:** Neutral-curious (hasn't formed a strong impression yet)
- **Roof repair status:** Overdue (a persistent background worry)
