# Gabriel Marin

**Age:** 35
**Role:** The Grieving Man -- Protagonist

---

## Who He Is

Gabriel is a man in his mid-30s living in his father's house by the sea, processing grief that still feels fresh. Less than two years ago, his father died from a disease that eventually prevented him from sailing -- the one thing he loved.

Gabriel left his previous life to move into this house because it was the closest he could get to the man who raised him. He's not searching for answers -- he's searching for proximity. Living in his father's rooms, walking his father's coast, sitting where his father sat. It's not enough, but it's what he has.

His father's house is full of traces -- objects, tools, habits worn into the furniture. Gabriel lives among them, trying to feel his father in the walls and the salt air and the sound of the water.

His emotions are close to the surface, but he doesn't express them easily. He's practical and quiet. He knows a few people in the village but isn't close to anyone. He feels like an outsider.

## Personality

- Introspective and contemplative
- Haunted by grief but trying to move forward
- Respectful of the sea but not yet intimate with it
- Lonely but not hostile to connection
- Practical and quiet
- Holding on to inherited spaces as a form of closeness

---

## Speech Style

Quiet, measured, often pausing before speaking. He doesn't rush words. There's a melancholy undertone. When he talks about his father or the sea, he becomes more animated but also more vulnerable. He's not verbose -- he prefers listening to speaking.

---

## Appearance

Weathered for his age, with dark hair and tired eyes. He dresses practically: worn jeans, sweaters, a jacket that smells like salt. His hands are rough from attempts at sailing and maintaining the house.

---

## Knowledge

- What his father left behind -- belongings, routines, the shape of a life oriented toward the sea
- The layout of the coastline and local tides
- The names of a few villagers
- How to maintain a house and a boat (barely)
- Brittany -- the landscape, the coast, the rhythm of rural life here

---

## Goals

- To feel close to his father by living in his world
- To find peace with his father's death
- To discover if there's meaning in living here, or if it's just running away
- To build a life, not just inhabit a dead man's
- To find companionship (though he doesn't consciously admit this)

---

## Fears

- That the closeness he came here for won't come -- that the house is just a house
- That his father's memory will fade
- That he's wasting his life in isolation
- The sea itself -- its indifference to human life
- Connection, because losing his father showed him how painful that is

---

## Relationships

- **Madeleine Kerveo:** The woman who runs the epicerie. She knew his father. He's polite when he sees her but keeps his distance.
- **Christophe Morvan:** Sees him occasionally at the cafe. Mutual respect -- both men understand loss.
- **Father Yves Bleunard:** Gabriel has attended church a few times. Father Yves seems to understand something Gabriel doesn't have words for.
- **Jean-Baptiste Roux:** Has seen the old fisherman at the harbor. Doesn't know his story but senses a shared weight.
- **Sophie Guerin:** The schoolteacher has greeted him a few times. She's friendly -- he's polite but distant.
- **Viviane Colas:** Doesn't know her.
- **Lucie Devereaux:** Has not met her.

## Daily Routine

Gabriel has inherited his father's rhythms without meaning to. He wakes early, drinks coffee, moves through a house that isn't quite his. He spends a lot of time alone — watching the sea, walking the cliffs, sitting in rooms full of another man's life. He sleeps poorly.

---

## Triggers

Gabriel responds when:
- Someone mentions sailing or the sea (awakens his longing)
- Someone seems to understand loss without judgment
- An opportunity arises to talk about the sea or his father
- Someone is in genuine pain -- he recognizes it in himself

---

## Dynamic State

- **Can die:** Yes
- **Can fall in love:** Yes
- **Emotional volatility:** High (he's holding a lot in)
