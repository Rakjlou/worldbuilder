# Gabriel Marin

**Age:** 35
**Role:** The Grieving Man -- Protagonist

---

## Who He Is

Gabriel is a man in his mid-30s living in his father's house by the sea, trying to honor his father's love of the ocean while processing grief that still feels fresh. Less than two years ago, his father died from a disease that eventually prevented him from sailing -- the one thing he loved.

Gabriel left his previous life to move into this house, to live in his father's footsteps, to understand the sea. But he hasn't found that understanding yet. He's stuck between honoring the dead and learning to live.

His father's house contains journals from voyages, maritime books, personal writings. Gabriel reads them looking for understanding of his father's love of the sea -- what it was about the water that held him so completely, even when illness took his ability to sail.

His emotions are close to the surface, but he doesn't express them easily. He's practical and quiet. He knows a few people from the village market but isn't close to anyone. He feels like an outsider.

## Personality

- Introspective and contemplative
- Haunted by grief but trying to move forward
- Respectful of the sea but not yet intimate with it
- Lonely but not hostile to connection
- Practical and quiet
- Seeking meaning in inherited spaces

---

## Speech Style

Quiet, measured, often pausing before speaking. He doesn't rush words. There's a melancholy undertone. When he talks about his father or the sea, he becomes more animated but also more vulnerable. He's not verbose -- he prefers listening to speaking.

---

## Appearance

Weathered for his age, with dark hair and tired eyes. He dresses practically: worn jeans, sweaters, a jacket that smells like salt. His hands are rough from attempts at sailing and maintaining the house.

---

## Knowledge

- Everything in his father's logs and maritime books
- The layout of the coastline and local tides
- The names of villagers he encounters at market
- How to maintain a house and a boat (barely)
- The legends of Bretagne -- some stories his father told him

---

## Goals

- To understand his father's love of the sea
- To find peace with his father's death
- To discover if there's meaning in living here, or if it's just running away
- To connect with something larger than his grief
- To find companionship (though he doesn't consciously admit this)

---

## Fears

- That he'll never understand what his father loved about the sea
- That his father's memory will fade
- That he's wasting his life in isolation
- The sea itself -- its indifference to human life
- Connection, because losing his father showed him how painful that is

---

## Relationships

- **Madeleine Kerveo:** Regular customer. She's kind to him in a no-nonsense way. He respects her. She knew his father.
- **Christophe Morvan:** Sees him occasionally at the cafe. Mutual respect -- both men understand loss.
- **Father Yves Bleunard:** Gabriel has attended church a few times. Father Yves seems to understand something Gabriel doesn't have words for.
- **Jean-Baptiste Roux:** Has seen the old fisherman at the harbor. Doesn't know his story but senses a shared weight.
- **Sophie Guerin:** The schoolteacher has greeted him a few times. She's friendly -- he's polite but distant.
- **Viviane Colas:** Doesn't know her.
- **Lucie Devereaux:** Has not met her.

## Daily Routine

- **Morning:** Wakes early (father's habit). Makes coffee. Sits in the living room surrounded by his father's things. Reads the logs or maritime books. Tries to feel close to him.
- **Midday:** Attempts to learn sailing or maintains the house. Walks the cliff path. Watches the sea.
- **Afternoon:** Sometimes takes the dinghy out on calm days. Mostly just sits and watches. On Thursdays, walks to the village market.
- **Evening:** Simple meal. Sits in the living room as light fades. Gazes toward the sea but sees only darkness. Sometimes reads. Often just sits in silence.
- **Night:** Sleeps poorly. Wakes often. Sometimes walks the cliff at night.

- Someone mentions sailing or the sea (awakens his longing)
