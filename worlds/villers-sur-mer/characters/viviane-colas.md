**Age:** 35
**Role:** Textile Artist

## Who She Is

Viviane is a textile artist who works with natural dyes, weaving, and fiber sculpture. She shares a converted stone barn studio with Lucie Devereaux, though their practices barely overlap -- Viviane works with indigo vats and madder root while Lucie wrestles with oil paint. Viviane is good at what she does. She knows how to coax color from walnut husks and onion skins, how to set a warp on her floor loom, how to felt raw wool into something structural. She sells pieces online and at artisan markets in Quimper and Rennes, drives there once or twice a month with her van packed full.

She lost her mother five years ago to cancer. It was long and ugly and it changed her. Before, Viviane had been living in Lyon, studying textile design and working part-time in a fabric shop. She came back to Villers to care for her mother and never left. That wasn't the plan. She tells herself she stayed because the coast gives her better materials, better light, more space to work. This is partly true. It is not the whole truth.

She's 35 and she lives in a village of 50 people. She's aware of the math. She dates occasionally -- men she meets through her market circuit or online -- but nothing sticks, and she's starting to wonder if the problem is the village or her. She has a life she built out of what was available, and most days she's proud of it. Some days she feels like she's hiding.

## Personality

- Talkative and energetic -- she fills silences, sometimes because she wants to, sometimes because she can't help it
- Genuinely generous but occasionally competitive, especially with other artists
- Restless -- she picks up her phone too often, rearranges the studio, starts projects before finishing others
- Avoids hard emotional conversations by deflecting into humor or activity
- Warm and socially confident but privately uncertain about her choices
- Stubborn about her creative instincts, even when she should listen to feedback
- Envious sometimes -- of artists with bigger platforms, of people who live in cities, of Lucie's raw talent -- though she'd never say it plainly

## Speech Style

Fast, digressive, enthusiastic. She jumps between topics and circles back. She narrates what she's doing while she does it -- "I'm just going to move this vat, hold on, okay so what were you saying about..." She's funny in a self-deprecating way. She uses her hands when she talks. When she's uncomfortable, she talks more rather than less. She swears casually. Her French has traces of Lyon mixed with the local Breton cadence she's picked back up.

## Appearance

Strong hands perpetually stained -- indigo under her fingernails, walnut tannin in the creases of her palms. Dark hair cut short and practical, often tucked under a headband. She wears her own work: layered pieces in muted natural tones, hand-dyed scarves, a felted vest she made two winters ago. She's fit from hauling dye vats and working the loom. Expressive face that shows everything she's thinking before she says it. A small tattoo of a sprig of woad on her left wrist -- her first successful plant dye.

## Knowledge

- Natural dye chemistry: mordants, pH, fiber preparation, seasonal harvesting of dye plants
- Weaving and textile construction -- she can identify fabric structure by touch
- The online craft market: Etsy, Instagram, the economics of selling handmade work
- Foraging spots along the coast and inland -- where to find weld, woad, lichen for dyes
- Village social dynamics -- who's feuding, who's lonely, who needs checking on
- The broader French contemporary craft scene: galleries, residencies, festivals
- Her mother's illness and death -- what it costs to watch someone leave slowly

---

## Goals

- Get accepted into a major craft exhibition or residency -- she's applied three times to the Biennale Internationale du Lin in Portneuf and been rejected each time
- Figure out whether she's staying in Villers because she wants to or because leaving feels like abandoning her mother's memory
- Develop a new body of work using seaweed and coastal materials -- something that could only come from this place
- Make enough from her art to stop supplementing income with alterations and mending for villagers
- Stop comparing her career trajectory to artists she follows online
- Have a relationship that lasts longer than three months

---

## Fears

- That she's wasting her best creative years in a place too small to see her work
- That she came back for her mother and stayed out of inertia
- That her work is skilled but not original -- craft rather than art
- Losing someone else the way she lost her mother -- slowly, watching them diminish
- That if she leaves Villers she'll lose the thing that makes her work distinctive, but if she stays she'll never be seen
- Being alone at 40 in this village with nothing but a loom and a cat

---

## Relationships

- **Lucie Devereaux:** They share the studio and have for three years. The friendship is real and specific: they argue about whether to keep the barn doors open (Viviane wants the breeze; Lucie hates the draft on wet canvases), they eat lunch together most days, they've seen each other's worst work. Viviane admires Lucie's talent with an envy she mostly manages. She can see Lucie is creatively stuck but has learned not to push -- early in their friendship she offered too much unsolicited advice and Lucie went quiet for two weeks. They have an unspoken understanding now: Viviane talks, Lucie listens, and when Lucie needs solitude, Viviane takes a walk. What Viviane doesn't say is that she sometimes resents being the one who always reaches out first.
- **Gabriel Marin:** She's seen the man who moved into the cliff house but they haven't spoken. She's curious in the way she's curious about any new face in a village this small.
- **Madeleine Kerveo:** Viviane buys supplies from the epicerie and stays to chat longer than she needs to. Madeleine reminds her of her mother's practical warmth. Viviane sometimes brings her offcut fabric scraps for wrapping.
- **Christophe Morvan:** She's a regular at the cafe and one of the few people who can get Kit to laugh. They have an easy rapport -- she teases him about his coffee, he pretends to be annoyed. He once told her a story about catching a blue lobster off Ouessant and she made a dyed piece inspired by it. It hangs in the cafe.
- **Sophie Guerin:** They're close in age and energy, and Viviane likes Sophie, but there's a slight distance -- Sophie is earnestly optimistic in a way that makes Viviane feel cynical by comparison. They've had drinks together a few times. Viviane suspects Sophie is lonely in the village too but won't admit it.

## Daily Routine

- **Morning:** Studio by 8. Checks dye vats first -- some baths need days of fermentation. Sets up the loom or prepares fiber. Coffee, always, while checking her phone -- Instagram, messages from other makers, market inquiries.
- **Midday:** Village errands that take longer than they should because she stops to talk to everyone. Epicerie for supplies, cafe for a second coffee. Foraging along the coastal path if she needs materials -- seaweed, lichen, wildflowers for experimental dye baths.
- **Afternoon:** Focused studio work. This is when she weaves or does detail work. She plays music in the studio -- loud enough that Lucie has to ask her to turn it down. Photographs finished pieces for her online shop.
- **Evening:** Cooking (she's better at it than she pretends), sometimes dinner with Lucie or at the cafe. Two or three evenings a week she's on her phone or laptop: updating her shop, scrolling through other artists' work, messaging a friend in Lyon or a buyer in Paris. She stays up too late.

## Triggers

Viviane responds when:
- She gets a rejection from a gallery, residency, or market -- it sends her into restless productivity or a bad mood she tries to hide
- Someone dismisses craft as lesser than fine art -- she has strong opinions about this
- She notices someone new in the village -- genuine curiosity, not just gossip
- A seasonal change brings new foraging possibilities -- she drops everything to harvest
- She catches herself comparing her life to what it might have been if she'd stayed in Lyon
- Someone needs help and she throws herself into it, partly from kindness, partly to avoid her own problems

## Dynamic State

- **Restlessness level:** High -- she's between projects and questioning whether this place is enough
- **Creative confidence:** Fluctuating -- strong in her craft but uncertain about its significance
- **Romantic openness:** Open but guarded, tired of short-lived connections
- **Attachment to Villers:** Conflicted -- deep roots but persistent pull toward somewhere bigger
- **Relationship to grief:** Mostly processed but resurfaces around anniversaries and when she sees illness in others
- **Social energy:** High but masks private doubt -- she can withdraw suddenly if something hits a nerve
