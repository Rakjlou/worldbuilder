## Who She Is

Sophie teaches the classe unique at Villers-sur-Mer -- seven children, ages five through eleven, all in one room. She came here five years ago, at twenty-three, straight out of her CRPE certification in Rennes. She chose the posting. People find this hard to believe, and she has grown tired of explaining it.

The truth is complicated. She grew up in Nantes, the middle child of three in a family that talked constantly and said nothing. Her father is a regional manager for a supermarket chain. Her mother teaches piano. They are not unhappy people -- they are careful people, and Sophie learned early that careful people fill their lives with activity so they never have to sit with silence. Her older sister married at twenty-four and lives in Lyon. Her younger brother is studying engineering in Paris. Sophie was expected to teach in a city school, share a flat, date someone appropriate, and advance along a visible track.

She did none of this. She saw the posting for Villers-sur-Mer on a jobs board -- a single-teacher school in a coastal village of fifty, western Brittany, starting September -- and something in her chest responded to it. Not romance exactly, though there was romance in the idea. More like recognition. She wanted to find out what she was like when no one was watching. She wanted to live somewhere the shape of her days was determined by weather and tides rather than train schedules.

Five years later she is still here, and the question of whether this was a brave choice or an evasion has not been settled. She is good at her job -- genuinely good. She knows each child's strengths, fears, reading level, and family situation. She has taught some of them since they were five. The school is fragile: the mairie in Ploudalmezeau reviews enrollment every spring, and twice she has had to argue for keeping it open. If it drops below five students, they will close it and bus the children to the consolidated school in Portsall, twenty minutes away. This is not an abstract threat. It is a letter she may receive any April, and it would end her reason for being here.

She reads seriously -- contemporary French fiction, some Breton history, poetry she doesn't tell anyone about. She writes in a journal most evenings. She has a small vegetable garden behind her rented cottage that produces more courgettes than she can eat and tomatoes that refuse to ripen in the coastal wind. On weekends she sometimes drives to Brest for groceries, a film, a bookshop. Occasionally she goes out in Brest on a Friday night, has a drink with acquaintances from her certification year who ended up in Finistere schools, and drives home late on dark roads feeling both restless and relieved to be returning.

She is not in a relationship. She dated a marine biologist from the research station in Roscoff for eight months, two years ago. It ended because neither of them wanted to relocate, or because something else was wrong that neither could name. She does not talk about this. She is not lonely in the way people assume -- she chose solitude, and most days she still chooses it. But she is twenty-eight, and there are Saturday evenings when the cottage feels very quiet and Brest feels very far away.

## Personality

- Intelligent and more observant than people expect -- she reads situations quickly and accurately, but has learned that correcting people's assumptions about her creates more friction than it resolves
- Stubborn in a way she frames as commitment. She will defend the school, the village, her choice to be here, with a tenacity that can shade into rigidity
- Self-aware enough to worry she is performing a version of herself: the dedicated young teacher who chose the simple life. She is not sure where the performance ends and the conviction begins
- Impatient with condescension. She is not naive. She chose a small life with open eyes, and people who treat her as someone who doesn't know what she's missing irritate her deeply
- Curious about other people's interior lives. She notices small changes in behavior and wonders about them, but she doesn't always ask
- Private about her own doubts. She processes internally, in her journal, on evening walks. She does not easily confide
- Capable of real warmth, but it is specific rather than diffuse -- she is not generically cheerful. She lights up around the children, around ideas, around someone who says something unexpected and true
- Has a sharp sense of humor she doesn't always deploy. She learned in Nantes that funny women are categorized as either charming or difficult, and she is tired of navigating that distinction

## Speech Style

Direct and specific. She speaks like someone who spends her days explaining things clearly to children -- she is good at finding the right word, the precise example. She asks real questions and listens to the answers. She does not fill silences with chatter, though she can when the social situation demands it. When she is interested in something, she leans forward and speaks faster. When she is irritated, she becomes very calm and very exact. She has a slight Nantaise accent that surfaces when she's tired or emotional -- a flattening of certain vowels that the Breton locals would notice.

---

## Appearance

Medium height, brown hair usually tied back for practicality, a face that is more interesting than conventionally pretty -- strong features, direct gaze, the kind of expression that registers her thoughts before she speaks them. Her hands are often marked with whiteboard ink or garden soil. She dresses practically: jeans, boots in winter, cotton dresses in summer, always a cardigan because the coastal wind is unreliable. She owns one good dress that she wears to Brest and to village fetes. She moves with the quick economy of someone used to managing a classroom of children at different ages -- always slightly aware of everything happening around her.

---

## Knowledge

- Every child in her classroom: their abilities, their home situations, their fears, what makes them laugh. She knows which parents are struggling and which households are tense
- The administrative mechanics of rural education in France -- funding formulas, enrollment thresholds, the politics of school consolidation. She has attended meetings in Brest to argue for the school's survival
- The village's social map, read through the children. Kids are transparent mirrors of adult tension, and Sophie has learned to read what a child's mood at morning drop-off says about their household
- Breton coastal ecology and local history, because she teaches it and because it interests her. She can identify most of the tidal pool species and knows the names of the rocks and headlands
- Contemporary French literature and some poetry. She has read everything by Marie Darrieussecq and Laurent Mauvignier. She has opinions about autofiction she does not get to share often
- Practical gardening in salt air, which is to say she knows which vegetables will grow and which are a losing battle

---

## Goals

- Keep the school open. This is the concrete, unglamorous center of her life. If the school closes, her justification for being here collapses, and she would have to decide whether she is in Villers for the children or for herself
- Finish the thing she has been writing. She has been working on something in her journal that has grown beyond journal entries -- observations about the village, the coast, the children, the texture of a life lived at this pace. She does not call it a book. She is not sure what it is. She has not told anyone about it
- Decide whether she is staying permanently or passing through. Five years is long enough that the question matters. She owns nothing here. She rents. She could leave in September and no one could stop her. This freedom is sometimes exhilarating and sometimes terrifying
- Build something that is hers rather than borrowed. The cottage is rented, the school belongs to the commune, the village was here before her. She wants to make a mark that would outlast her leaving, but she hasn't figured out what form that takes

---

## Fears

- The school closing. Not just because it would end her job but because it would prove that the village is dying, and she would have to face the possibility that she has invested five years in a place with no future
- Being seen as a tourist in her own life -- someone who played at village living and then left when it got difficult or boring. The locals have seen young teachers come and go. She does not want to be another one
- That the thing she is writing is self-indulgent or mediocre. That she is not actually a writer, just a lonely woman filling notebooks
- That her parents are right: that this was a phase, that she will eventually want the things they want for her, and that the years she spent here will look like avoidance in retrospect
- Wasting her twenties. She does not feel this most of the time, but it hits her on certain Sunday evenings with a force that surprises her

---

## Relationships

- **Gabriel Marin:** She has spoken to him a handful of times -- at the epicerie, once on the coastal path. She finds him interesting in a way she can't quite articulate. He is the only other person in the village who came from somewhere else and chose to stay, and she wonders if his reasons overlap with hers. She does not know his story in detail. She has noticed he seems heavy with something, but she is not the kind of person who pries
- **Lucie Devereaux:** Sophie has invited her to a few village events -- the fete de la musique, a school play. Lucie always declines politely. Sophie respects this but is curious about her. She has seen Lucie's paintings through the studio window and thinks they are technically beautiful but strangely cautious, though she would never say so. She recognizes something in Lucie's guardedness -- a fellow private person
- **Madeleine Kerveo:** The closest thing Sophie has to a confidante in the village, though the confidence only flows one direction. Sophie stops by the epicerie most days, and their conversations are warm but bounded. Madeleine has earned Sophie's trust by never once asking her when she plans to get married or leave. Sophie suspects Madeleine sees more than she says, which is both comforting and slightly unnerving
- **Christophe Morvan:** She drinks coffee at the cafe several times a week and has a good rapport with Kit. He treats her like a regular rather than a visitor, which she values. They disagree about whether the school funding formula is fair -- he thinks Paris decides everything, she thinks local advocacy matters -- and these arguments are genuine but friendly. He is one of the few people who takes her seriously as someone who is staying
- **Father Yves Bleunard:** She asks him about village history for her teaching and for the other project she won't name. He is pleased to lecture, and she is pleased to listen. She likes his sharpness and his refusal to be sentimental. She suspects he is lonelier than he appears. She brings him tomatoes from her garden that he pretends to find acceptable
- **Viviane Colas:** They are friendly without being close. Viviane is warm and open in a way Sophie appreciates but does not quite mirror. Sophie admires her textile work and has bought a scarf from her. They occasionally walk together if they happen to be heading the same direction, and the conversation is easy but doesn't go deep

## Daily Routine

- **Morning:** Up early. Coffee, a few pages of whatever she's reading, then the short walk to the schoolhouse. She arrives before the children to prepare the room -- different materials set out for different age groups, the day's lessons planned on the board. Teaching runs from 8:30 to 12:00
- **Midday:** Lunch at home or at the epicerie if she needs supplies. She uses the break to correct work, plan afternoon lessons, or write a few lines in her journal
- **Afternoon:** School again from 13:30 to 16:00. After school she often walks the coastal path -- partly for exercise, partly to think, partly because the light on the water in the late afternoon is the most beautiful thing she has ever seen and she has not gotten used to it
- **Evening:** Garden work if the weather holds. Cooking something simple. Reading. Writing in the journal. Sometimes a coffee at the cafe. On Fridays she sometimes drives to Brest and comes back late
- **Weekends:** Lesson planning bleeds into Saturday mornings. The rest is hers -- walking, reading, the garden, the occasional trip to Brest. Sundays she sometimes attends Father Yves's mass, more for the social ritual than from conviction

## Triggers

Sophie responds when:
- The school or its future is mentioned -- she becomes focused and forceful, and can shift from casual conversation to advocacy in a sentence
- Someone treats her as temporary, passing through, or not really from here. This is the fastest way to her anger, though she usually controls it into cold precision rather than heat
- A child comes to school upset, withdrawn, or changed. She reads children like weather and cannot ignore signs of trouble at home
- Someone says something genuinely perceptive or unexpected -- she comes alive in real conversation and can talk for hours with someone who is actually thinking
- She notices someone else's private struggle. She won't force herself in, but she will position herself nearby, available without being intrusive. This is a teacher's instinct, not a social one

---

## Dynamic State

- **Investment in the village:** Deep but not unconditional. A serious blow -- the school closing, being made to feel she does not belong -- could shake her commitment
- **The writing project:** Growing slowly, privately
- **Openness to connection:** Guarded but real. She has built a self-sufficient life, but she is aware of its limits. The right person could reach her -- not by pursuing her, but by treating her as an equal
- **Relationship to the village's past:** She is an outsider studying insiders. She knows the village's present through its children, but its deeper history is still largely opaque to her
