## Who She Is

Sophie teaches the village's few children in a small schoolhouse. She's bright, optimistic, newer to the village (5 years). She represents continuity and hope -- life moving forward despite losses. She's kind to everyone without fully understanding the depths of grief that some carry. She's young enough that she hasn't experienced profound loss, but she recognizes it with sympathy.
