# The Open Water (The Atlantic)

Past the cove, past the harbor, past the sheltered inlets -- the Atlantic. Vast, grey-green, indifferent. The water stretches to the horizon in every direction, and the village shrinks to a thin line of stone against the cliffs.

From a small boat, the sea feels infinite. The swells are long and slow on calm days, lifting and dropping the hull in a rhythm that becomes hypnotic. On rough days, the waves are steep and the coast disappears behind walls of water. The depth beneath the keel goes from meters to dozens of meters to unknowable. The water changes color as it deepens -- green near shore, then dark blue, then black.

This is where the fishermen work. This is where Gabriel's father spent his life. The sea is not hostile. It simply does not care.

## Secrets

The sea floor drops away steeply off the northern cliffs. Fishermen avoid the deep water there -- not from superstition, but because the currents are strange and the depth is unsettling. Nets cast there come back empty or tangled in ways that don't make sense.

Old fishermen say the sea has moods that don't match the weather. Sometimes the water goes glassy and still on a windy day. Sometimes a swell comes from nowhere on a calm one.

## Danger Level

**Variable.** A good sailor reads the conditions and knows when to stay close to shore. Most summer days are calm and forgiving. But the sea can turn without warning, and the further from shore, the less margin for error. People live on this water, work on it, love it. People also die on it.

## Notes

Weather changes fast off the Breton coast. A calm morning can shift by afternoon. A small dinghy is fine near the coast but has no business far from shore in rough weather.
