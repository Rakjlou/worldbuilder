# The Open Water (The Atlantic)

Past the harbor, past the sheltered inlets -- the Atlantic. Vast, grey-green, indifferent. The water stretches to the horizon in every direction, and the village shrinks to a thin line of stone against the cliffs.

From a small boat, the sea feels infinite. The swells are long and slow on calm days, lifting and dropping the hull in a rhythm that becomes hypnotic. On rough days, the waves are steep and the coast disappears behind walls of water. The depth beneath the keel goes from meters to dozens of meters to unknowable. The water changes color as it deepens -- green near shore, then dark blue, then black.

This is where the fishermen work. This is where Gabriel's father spent his life. The sea is not hostile. It simply does not care.

## Secrets

The sea floor drops away steeply off the northern cliffs. The depth change produces strong lateral currents that fishermen avoid -- not worth the risk for the catch. Further out, the Atlantic shelf drops sharply, and the water temperature changes enough that fog can form over the cold patch on warm days.

Weather changes fast off this coast. A high-pressure system can stall and give a week of calm, or a low can come through in hours and turn the sea from flat to four-meter swells. Fishermen read the sky and the barometric pressure, not the forecast.

## Danger Level

**Variable.** A good sailor reads the conditions and knows when to stay close to shore. Most summer days are calm and forgiving. But the sea can turn without warning, and the further from shore, the less margin for error. People live on this water, work on it, love it. People also die on it.

## Notes

Weather changes fast off the Breton coast. A calm morning can shift by afternoon. A small dinghy is fine near the coast but has no business far from shore in rough weather.
