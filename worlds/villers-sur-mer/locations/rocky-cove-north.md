# Rocky Cove (North of Gabriel's House)

A small cove accessible via a narrow, treacherous path down the cliff face. Dark granite rocks, smoothed by centuries of Atlantic waves. At high tide, water crashes violently against the stone. At low tide, tidal pools reveal sea life. Seaweed-slicked boulders.

The water is cold, deep, dark green. A natural cave mouth yawns in the cliff face, accessible only at certain tides. This is where Gabriel keeps his small dinghy, moored to a weathered ring bolt.
