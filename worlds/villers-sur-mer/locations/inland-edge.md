# The Inland Edge

The back of Villers-sur-Mer is where the last granite houses give way to the countryside. There is no sharp boundary — just a narrowing of buildings, a last garden wall, and then the bocage opens up: rolling fields divided by earth banks topped with gorse and blackthorn, the hedgerow network that has shaped west Brittany for centuries. The D-road runs through here, two lanes of patched asphalt that head inland through shallow curves until the village disappears behind a rise and there is nothing but fields in every direction.

Standing at the inland edge and looking back toward Villers, you see the rooflines — grey slate, the occasional chimney — low against the sky, with no indication that the sea is only a few hundred meters in the other direction. Looking inland, the view is green and horizontal, broken by the rounded tops of hedgerows and the occasional stand of oak or poplar. A farm track runs northeast from the road, marked by two concrete posts and a gate of galvanized steel tubing. The fields closest to the village have been mown for hay; further out, cattle graze behind wire fencing. In summer, the roadside verges are thick with cow parsley and dock.

The air here is different from the sea-facing side of the village. Still. Warmer in the afternoon. Without the salt and the sound of water. A truck on the D-road can be heard well before it arrives, engine noise carrying clearly across the fields. Twice a week, early morning, the wholesaler's van comes this way for Madeleine. Occasionally a tractor moves between fields, slow and deliberate. Otherwise the road is quiet for long stretches, and the village sits at its back like something that does not quite belong to the landscape around it.

## Atmosphere

Still, open, warm, workaday, rural, unassuming

---

## Connected Locations

- Village Center -- the D-road leads directly in from here, five minutes on foot
- Nearest town (15-20 km) -- the D-road heads inland toward it; this is the only paved route in or out by land

---

## Who Is Found Here

- Madeleine Kerveo -- Tuesdays and Fridays, early morning, waiting for or unloading the wholesaler's delivery van
- Sophie Guerin -- On the road when she travels to town; occasionally walking the verge in the evening
- Local farmers -- Operating machinery in the adjacent fields, moving between properties along the farm track

---

## Items Present

- D-road surface -- Two-lane asphalt, worn at the edges, patched in several places with darker bitumen; white center line faded to near-invisibility
- Galvanized gate -- Steel-tube farm gate at the track entrance, secured with a chain and padlock; hinges spotted with rust
- Concrete distance marker -- Old post at the roadside, department number and a distance to the nearest town, the paint worn but still legible
- Roadside verge vegetation -- Cow parsley, dock, grass, a few patches of bramble where the bank has been left untrimmed
- Wire fencing -- Standard agricultural stock fencing along field boundaries closest to the road
- Gravel pull-off -- A widened shoulder near the last house, unpaved, used by the delivery van to turn around

## Secrets

The farm track to the northeast leads to a property that has not been actively farmed for several years; the fields are still mown by a neighboring farmer under an informal arrangement, which is why they do not look abandoned. The D-road has a slight but consistent downhill grade heading into the village, noticeable only on a bicycle.

## Danger Level

**Low** (rural road with occasional vehicle traffic; no lighting at night)
