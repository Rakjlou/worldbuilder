# Village Harbor

A small natural inlet cut into the base of the cliffs, south of the village center and reachable by a steep path of worn stone steps. The quay is dark granite, built in two sections: an older outer wall that takes the weather and a shorter inner dock where the boats tie up. The wall is stained at the waterline with a band of rust and algae that shifts with the tidal range. At low tide, the granite apron below the dock is exposed, slick and encrusted with barnacles. At high tide, the water comes up within arm's reach of the mooring rings. There are four working boats here on most mornings: Baptiste's trawler, two smaller open boats belonging to other fishermen, and Gabriel's dinghy, tied at the shoreward end.

The smell is pervasive and specific -- diesel, salt water, fish offal, the particular rot of wet rope left too long in a bucket. It changes with the wind: stronger in the late morning when boats return, lighter by afternoon when the catch has gone up to the village. There is noise when boats are coming in or going out -- engines, the clatter of equipment, men talking in the shorthand of people who work together daily. Otherwise the harbor is quiet. The water slaps against the hulls. Gulls land on the dock bollards and stand there. The rigging of Baptiste's trawler knocks in any kind of breeze.

The light here is different from the open cliff. The harbor sits low, the walls catch the morning sun from the east and the afternoon sun bounces off the water in a way that is hard on the eyes. In the early morning, before the boats leave, the harbor is lit grey and flat, and the village above is already in light while the quay is still in shadow. The fishermen work in that shadow without seeming to notice it.

## Atmosphere

Functional, salt-weathered, purposeful, quiet in the off-hours, smelling of work

---

## Connected Locations

- Village Center -- Uphill by the stone steps, five minutes on foot, steep enough that the fishermen carry fish in buckets balanced across their shoulders
- Sandy Beach South -- Further south along the coastal path, past the outer wall
- The Open Water -- The harbor mouth opens directly onto the Atlantic; a boat can clear the inlet in under a minute

## Who Is Found Here

- Baptiste Roux -- Most mornings before dawn, rigging his trawler or already gone. Returns mid-morning with the catch. Mends nets on the dock in the afternoons two or three times a week.
- Other fishermen -- Two or three men who keep boats here. They come and go on their own schedules, nodding at each other, rarely talking at length.
- Kit Morvan -- Visits irregularly, usually mid-morning after the boats are back. He walks the dock, watches the water, sometimes helps with nets if someone will let him. Nobody asks him to leave.
- Gabriel Marin -- Comes down occasionally, more often in the evenings when the working day is done and he has the quay to himself. Takes his dinghy out sometimes, not far.

## Items Present

- Baptiste's trawler -- A twelve-meter wooden-hulled boat, repainted within the last few years but aging at the waterline. Navigation electronics newer than the hull. Named "Marie-Thérèse" in letters that have faded but are still legible.
- Two open fishing boats -- Fiberglass, outboard motors, belonging to other village fishermen. Nothing remarkable about them.
- Gabriel's dinghy -- A three-meter inflatable with a small outboard, deflated and rolled against the dock wall between uses, or tied up near the inner dock when rigged.
- Mooring rings -- Cast iron, bolted into the granite at intervals, each worn to a different degree. The oldest ones are almost round with corrosion.
- Net bins -- Two large plastic bins at the inner dock, used for storing working nets. One is cracked along the base from years of use.
- Fuel drum -- A red diesel drum on a frame near the dock steps, with a manual hand pump. Locked with a padlock whose key everyone with a boat seems to have a copy of.
- A wooden bench -- Set against the harbor wall near the steps, salt-grey and splintered on the backrest. Used for sitting while waiting, or for setting down gear.
- Gutting table -- A waist-high wooden table with a stainless steel top, bolted to the dock near a drain. A hose on a reel is coiled on the wall next to it.

## Secrets

The inner dock surface has a slow lean toward the water on the north end -- a few centimeters of tilt -- where the granite has shifted over decades. Nobody has repaired it. Everyone knows to mind their step there when the stone is wet. The outer wall has a section that was patched sometime in the 1980s with poured concrete, visibly different in color and texture from the original granite. The patch holds, but it sweats moisture in cold weather and the locals know not to tie up against it.

## Danger Level

**Low** (physically unremarkable in calm conditions; the dock steps are slippery when wet and the tidal drop is significant -- a person who fell between a boat and the dock at low tide would have a difficult time getting out without help)
