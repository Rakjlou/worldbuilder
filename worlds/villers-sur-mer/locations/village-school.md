# The Village School (École de Villers-sur-Mer)

A low stone building on the edge of the village square, one storey, with a slate roof and two tall windows facing east. The facade is plain -- the commune's crest above the door, a painted sign with the school's name, both slightly faded. A chain-link fence encloses a small yard of packed gravel with a rusted swing set and a painted hopscotch grid that Sophie re-paints every September. A vegetable patch runs along the south wall, tended by the older children as a science project. In summer the door and windows stand open from eight in the morning, and the sound of Sophie's voice carrying through the window -- reading aloud, explaining, asking questions -- drifts across the square.

The single classroom is long and narrow, lit from both sides. One half belongs to the younger children: low tables pushed together, a reading corner with a carpet square and board books on a low shelf, laminated alphabet strips taped above the chalkboard. The other half is the older children's workspace: higher tables, textbooks stacked at each seat, a row of geography maps rolled and stored in a wooden rack. Sophie moves between both halves across the day, setting independent tasks for one group while she teaches the other directly. The chalkboard is divided in thirds: the day's date and a short sentence the younger ones copy, a maths problem for the middles, a comprehension question for the oldest. The ceiling has a water stain above the reading corner that the mairie has agreed to repair for three years. The walls are covered in drawings, printed pages about Breton coastal ecology, a timeline of Brittany history, and a handwritten poster about the life cycle of the brown crab, illustrated by a nine-year-old in considerable anatomical detail.

During the two-hour lunch break the room is empty, chalk dust settling, the gravel yard quiet except for wind. After school hours Sophie stays to correct notebooks at her desk, which is pushed against the far wall facing away from the window -- she claims she reads faster when she cannot see the sea. The building smells of chalk, damp stone, and the particular warm paper smell of children's exercise books left in the sun. In summer there is also always the smell of the ocean, coming through the windows with everything else.

## Atmosphere

Lived-in, crowded with paper, noisy in the mornings, quiet at lunch, practical, slightly cramped

---

## Connected Locations

- Village Center -- directly adjacent, across a narrow lane

---

## Who Is Found Here

- Sophie Guerin -- here every school day from 8:00 to 16:30 or later; sometimes on weekends to plan or correct work
- Village children (seven currently enrolled, ages 5--11) -- school days, 8:30 to 12:00 and 13:30 to 16:00
- Parents -- at drop-off and pickup; occasionally for the two school events Sophie organises each year (a Christmas performance, a spring open day)

---

## Items Present

- Chalkboard -- full-length, divided into zones for different age groups; a new one was installed when Sophie arrived, the old one removed to the yard where it leans against the fence
- Children's exercise books -- stacked at each place, corrected in red and green biro; Sophie uses green for encouragement, red for corrections only
- Sophie's desk -- a heavy wooden teacher's desk, scratched along the top, with a locked drawer where she keeps enrollment paperwork and the academic year correspondence with the académie
- Textbooks -- a mixed set, some current editions from the national curriculum, some older ones Sophie uses for supplementary material; stacked and sorted by year level
- A Breton-French glossary sheet -- laminated, one per table, something Sophie made herself in her first year
- The vegetable patch outside -- currently growing lettuces, radishes, and one courgette plant the children check on each morning as a ritual
- A first aid kit -- mounted beside the door, inspected termly
- A cast-iron radiator -- along the north wall, turns on in October, the children closest to it are the warmest; assigned seating rotates monthly
- A wall clock -- battery-powered, its second hand ticks audibly in silence

## Secrets

The enrollment register Sophie keeps in her locked desk drawer shows seven names, but the académie's threshold for closure is five -- which means she has two children of buffer between this school and a letter from Brest. She knows which families are thinking of leaving the village and has not yet told anyone in the village how close the numbers sit. The older children's table has initials carved into the underside of the surface going back at least thirty years; Sophie has not discouraged the newer additions.

## Danger Level

**None** (a functioning village school in summer; the only risk is administrative, not physical)
