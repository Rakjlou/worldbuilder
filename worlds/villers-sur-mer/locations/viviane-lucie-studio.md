# Artist Studio (Viviane & Lucie's Barn)

A converted stone barn at the southern edge of the village, transformed into a shared artist studio. Large windows flood the space with changing light throughout the day.

Canvases lean against walls -- subjects vary, some finished, many abandoned. Easels hold works in progress. Paint-stained tables hold supplies: watercolors, acrylics, charcoal, brushes. Sketches cover the walls. The air smells of paint and linseed oil.

The barn is divided into two sides: Viviane's textile corner (dyes, fabrics, a natural dye vat) and Lucie's painting space (cluttered, restless -- canvases started and set aside, evidence of someone searching for something).

## Secrets

Lucie's canvases tell the story of someone searching. The subjects shift -- landscapes, still lifes, portraits, abstractions -- never settling. Some paintings are technically accomplished but feel hollow. A few sketches, hidden in the back, are of her brother. She doesn't show those to anyone.
