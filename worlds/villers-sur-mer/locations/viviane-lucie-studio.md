# Artist Studio (Viviane & Lucie's Barn)

A converted stone barn at the southern edge of the village, transformed into a shared artist studio. Huge windows face the sea, flooding the space with changing light throughout the day.

Canvases lean against walls -- dozens of them, most depicting water in different moods, seasons, light. Easels hold works in progress. Paint-stained tables hold supplies: watercolors, acrylics, charcoal, brushes. Sketches cover the walls. The air smells of paint and salt.

The barn is divided into two sides: Viviane's textile corner (dyes, fabrics, a natural dye vat) and Lucie's painting space (more chaotic, more obsessive).

## Secrets

Some of Lucie's paintings feature a dreamlike shimmer deep in dark water -- a jellyfish-like glow suspended in the abyss. She says she dreams of it sometimes, though she's never seen it while awake. The paintings are haunting.

There's a series of paintings that suggest Lucie has painted the same scene repeatedly, trying to understand something.

Hidden in the back: old sketches of Lucie's brother, which she rarely shows anyone.

A journal where Lucie writes observations about the sea's moods and tides.
