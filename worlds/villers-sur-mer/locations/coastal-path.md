# The Coastal Path

A dirt and compacted-gravel track running roughly north to south along the cliff edge, connecting the last houses of the village to the isolated northern end of the headland where Gabriel lives. The walk takes about fifteen minutes at a normal pace. The surface is uneven in places — roots from coastal scrub push through, and winter erosion leaves shallow ruts that dry hard through the summer. In wet weather the low sections collect mud. There is no formal maintenance; the path holds its shape because people walk it.

The path is largely exposed. Chest-high gorse and broom grow on the landward side in irregular clumps, providing little wind shelter. To the seaward side the ground slopes away unevenly toward the cliff edge, which is unfenced for most of the route. The drop is not always visible from the path itself, but the sound of the sea is constant — swells hitting granite below, varying in intensity with the weather. In summer the wind comes off the Atlantic directly, cool even in July, and the light at midday is very bright. The path smells of salt, warm grass, and the faint sweetness of gorse when it is in flower.

The southern end joins the edge of the village near the last houses, where the track widens and meets a paved lane. The northern end narrows as it approaches Gabriel's property, and a branch veers slightly toward the cliff promontory where the Cliff Overlook sits. The main path continues past a low drystone wall, which marks the outer boundary of Gabriel's yard. At no point does the path have lighting. After dark it is navigated by familiarity or a torch.

## Atmosphere

Exposed, windswept, plain, open, unremarkable in good weather, uncomfortable in bad

---

## Connected Locations

- Gabriel's House -- northern end of the path, accessed through the break in the drystone wall
- Cliff Overlook -- a fork just north of center branches seaward to the promontory
- Village Center -- southern end, where the path meets the paved village lane

---

## Who Is Found Here

- Gabriel Marin -- most days, going to or coming back from the village; usually in the morning
- Sophie Guerin -- occasionally, on walks for fresh air after school, no fixed schedule
- Viviane Colas -- occasionally, foraging for natural dye materials (seaweed, lichen, wildflowers)
- Dog-walkers from the village -- mornings and evenings; a few regulars
- Tourists -- in summer, some walk the cliff route; they tend to move slowly and stop often at the seaward side

---

## Items Present

- Worn path surface -- compacted earth and gravel, with exposed roots in several stretches
- Drystone wall (northern end) -- low, partial, marks the boundary of Gabriel's land; a section has collapsed and not been repaired
- Wooden post (mid-path) -- a single old marker post, paint mostly gone, purpose was probably directional; still standing but leans seaward
- Scattered gorse -- lines the landward side; branches extend onto the path in a few spots and catch clothing

## Secrets

The muddiest section, about a third of the way from the village, sits in a shallow depression where water drains off the headland; anyone who walks this path in winter learns to step to the right where the ground is slightly higher and firmer. The wooden post mid-path has a rusted iron ring at its base that once held a gate chain — there was a gate here at some point, though nothing remains of the other post.

## Danger Level

**Low-Medium** (unfenced cliff edge to seaward side in places; no lighting after dark; path surface is uneven but walkable)
