# Gabriel's House

A stone cottage perched on the northern cliff, accessed by a winding path through wild grass and weather-beaten rocks. The house is weathered but solid, with salt-faded shutters and a small chimney.

Inside, the rooms still hold Gabriel's father's belongings -- sailing maps on the walls, ship's compasses, photographs of a younger man on various vessels. The living room faces the sea through large windows. A fireplace, bookshelves full of maritime books, comfortable but worn furniture.

## Atmosphere

Melancholic, frozen in time, introspective, lonely, full of longing

---

---

## Items Present

- Father's belongings -- Nautical charts, navigation tools, a barometer he checked every morning, oilskins hanging by the door, rope coiled the way he liked it. No journals, no letters -- he was not a writing man. His presence is in the wear patterns, not in words.
- Ship's compass -- On the living room mantle
- Family photographs -- Old photos on the walls
- Dinghy -- Small boat kept at the village harbor

## Secrets

The father lived alone for years after his wife's death. He was a practical man -- a sailor, not a philosopher. He loved the sea the way some people love their work: it was what he did, where he was himself, where the world made sense. When disease took his ability to sail, he watched the water from the living room because it was all he had left. The house reflects a man who simplified his life down to essentials. The fridge had expired food when Gabriel arrived. His clothes still smell like salt.

The study door sticks in humid weather.

## Rooms

### Living Room
The heart of the house. Large windows facing the sea. Fireplace, bookshelves, sailing charts, ship's compass on mantle, comfortable but worn furniture. Gabriel spends most of his time here.

### Father's Bedroom
His father's clothes are still in the wardrobe. The bed is made. Gabriel hasn't changed much in here.

### Kitchen
Functional, sparse. Gabriel cooks simply.

### Gabriel's Bedroom
Small, impersonal. He barely sleeps.

### Study
His father's room. Maritime books, charts, maps on every surface. Navigation references, tide tables, a shelf of Admiralty pilots. The reading of a working sailor, not a mystic.
