# Gabriel's House (The Sailor's Shrine)

A stone cottage perched on the northern cliff, accessed by a winding path through wild grass and weather-beaten rocks. The house is weathered but solid, with weathered shutters and a small chimney.

Inside, every room is haunted by the ghost of Gabriel's father -- sailing maps on the walls, ship's compasses, leather logs from voyages, photographs of a younger man on various vessels. The living room is the heart of this shrine: large windows face the sea, a fireplace holds maritime memories, shelves groan with books about ships and sailing.

## Secrets

A leather journal in the father's bedroom drawer, filled with personal reflections on the sea, voyages, and something he felt in the deep water that he struggled to put into words. The entries grow more searching toward the end -- less about sailing, more about meaning.

An unfinished painting -- something abstract, luminous, as if the father was trying to capture a feeling rather than a subject. It hangs in the study, facing the window.

## Rooms

### Living Room
The heart of the house. Large windows facing the sea. Fireplace, bookshelves, sailing charts, ship's compass on mantle, comfortable but worn furniture. Gabriel spends most of his time here.

### Father's Bedroom
Untouched since his death. Bed perfectly made. Wardrobe of his clothes. Personal effects. The journal is here.

### Kitchen
Functional, sparse. Gabriel cooks simply.

### Gabriel's Bedroom
Small, impersonal. He barely sleeps.

### Study
Contains his father's sailing logs and maritime books. Maps everywhere.
