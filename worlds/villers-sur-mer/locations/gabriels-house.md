# Gabriel's House

A stone cottage perched on the northern cliff, accessed by a winding path through wild grass and weather-beaten rocks. The house is weathered but solid, with salt-faded shutters and a small chimney.

Inside, the rooms still hold Gabriel's father's belongings -- sailing maps on the walls, ship's compasses, photographs of a younger man on various vessels. The living room faces the sea through large windows. A fireplace, bookshelves full of maritime books, comfortable but worn furniture.

## Secrets

The father lived alone for years after his wife's death. The house reflects a man who simplified his life down to essentials: the sea, his routines, his memories. The fridge had expired food when Gabriel arrived. His clothes still smell like salt.

The study door sticks in humid weather.

## Rooms

### Living Room
The heart of the house. Large windows facing the sea. Fireplace, bookshelves, sailing charts, ship's compass on mantle, comfortable but worn furniture. Gabriel spends most of his time here.

### Father's Bedroom
His father's clothes are still in the wardrobe. The bed is made. Gabriel hasn't changed much in here.

### Kitchen
Functional, sparse. Gabriel cooks simply.

### Gabriel's Bedroom
Small, impersonal. He barely sleeps.

### Study
His father's room. Maritime books, maps on every surface. Gabriel sits here sometimes when he wants to be surrounded by his father's things.
