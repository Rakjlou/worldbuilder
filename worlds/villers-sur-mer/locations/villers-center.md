# Villers sur Mer -- Village Center

A small square clustered with stone buildings: the epicerie, the cafe, the church. Narrow streets radiate outward to scattered cottages. A small harbor visible to the south. The square has a weathered bench and a bulletin board.

The atmosphere is quiet, intimate -- everyone knows everyone, but there's room for solitude.

## Secrets

**Old legends speak of a shimmering creature in the deepest waters** -- a jellyfish of light that appears to drowning sailors in their final moments sinking into the abyss. Some say those who see her are given a choice. But those who see her rarely return to tell of it.

The old folks' legends about the jellyfish spirit are more widely known than Gabriel realizes.

There's a small undercurrent of grief here -- most families have lost someone to the sea.
