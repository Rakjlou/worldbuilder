# Villers sur Mer -- Village Center

A small square clustered with stone buildings: the epicerie, the cafe, the church. Narrow streets radiate outward to scattered cottages. A small harbor visible to the south. The square has a weathered bench and a bulletin board.

The atmosphere is quiet, intimate -- everyone knows everyone, but there's room for solitude.

## Secrets

The oldest villagers whisper old tales about something in the deep water -- stories passed down from grandparents, half-remembered and half-believed. The details vary with each telling. Most younger residents have never heard them, or dismiss them as fishermen's superstition.

There's a small undercurrent of grief here -- most families have lost someone to the sea.
