# Villers sur Mer -- Village Center

A small square clustered with stone buildings: the epicerie, the cafe, the church. Narrow streets radiate outward to scattered cottages. A small harbor visible to the south. The square has a weathered bench and a bulletin board.

The atmosphere is quiet, intimate -- everyone knows everyone, but there's room for solitude.

## Secrets

Most families in the village have lost someone to the sea over the generations. It's not discussed often, but it shows in small ways -- the widows who still live alone, the family names on the war memorial that also appear in the harbor's drowning records, the way older residents glance at the water when the weather shifts.
