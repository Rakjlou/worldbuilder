# Cliff Overlook (North)

A windswept promontory on the northern cliff, five minutes' walk from Gabriel's house along a narrow path through wild grass. The cliff edge drops sheer into the Atlantic -- thirty meters of dark granite ending in churning water and spray.

A weathered stone bench sits near the edge, placed decades ago by someone who wanted to watch the sea. The grass around it is worn flat. On clear days, the horizon is a clean line between grey-blue water and sky. On stormy days, the wind is strong enough to stagger a person.

This is where Gabriel comes when the house feels too close. It's where his father came before him.

## Secrets

The stone bench shows decades of wear -- someone sat here often, for years. Scratches on the armrest suggest a habit of tracing patterns while watching the sea. This was Gabriel's father's place. Gabriel has found himself drawn to it too, sitting where his father sat, watching what his father watched.

## Danger Level

**Medium-High** (sheer cliff edge, strong winds, no railing; emotionally charged)
