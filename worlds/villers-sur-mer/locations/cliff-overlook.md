# Cliff Overlook (North)

A windswept promontory on the northern cliff, five minutes' walk from Gabriel's house along a narrow path through wild grass. The cliff edge drops sheer into the Atlantic -- thirty meters of dark granite ending in churning water and spray.

A weathered stone bench sits near the edge, placed decades ago by someone who wanted to watch the sea. The grass around it is worn flat. On clear days, the horizon is a clean line between grey-blue water and sky. On stormy days, the wind is strong enough to stagger a person.

This is where Gabriel comes when the house feels too close.

## Secrets

The stone bench shows decades of wear -- several people have used it over the years, villagers who wanted to sit and watch the water. Gabriel's father came here sometimes. So do others. The grass is worn flat from foot traffic more than from any single person's vigil.

## Danger Level

**Medium-High** (sheer cliff edge, strong winds, no railing; emotionally charged)
