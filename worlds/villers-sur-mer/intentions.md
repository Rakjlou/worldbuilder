# Author's Intentions: Villers-sur-Mer

## Themes

- **Grief and Healing:** Both Gabriel and Lucie carry loss, though they are not at the same stage. Healing comes through connection and love.
- **Acceptance is Loss:** True acceptance requires giving something up. Gabriel must lose his old self to find peace.
- **Love as Proxy:** Through his love for Lucie, Gabriel makes peace with his father's death. Through her love for Gabriel, Lucie finds her true art.
- **Beauty and Danger:** The sea is both beautiful and merciless. Life and death coexist.

## Ending Direction

The story moves toward sacrifice and transcendence. Gabriel reaches acceptance of loss -- first his father's, then Lucie's -- through love and ultimately through giving himself. The ending should feel inevitable and earned, not arbitrary.

## Character Arcs

### Gabriel Marin
From grief and denial toward understanding and acceptance. He starts unable to understand his father's love of the sea. His arc is about learning that love does not prevent loss -- love honors loss.

### Lucie Devereaux
From isolation toward connection through art. She begins focused on freezing time through painting. Meeting Gabriel opens her to the present. Her arc is about the tension between capturing beauty and being consumed by it.

### The Creature
Does not arc. She is a constant: nature itself, operating by balance. She is not evil, not kind -- simply inevitable.

## Rails (cannot be derailed by player choices)

- Lucie dies at sea at some point (this is the inciting crisis)
- The creature demands balance (life for life)
- Gabriel's arc ends in sacrifice (the specific form may vary)

## Boundaries (what this story is NOT)

- Not a horror story (the creature is not evil)
- Not a tragedy without hope (the sacrifice is transcendence)
- Not a puzzle story (cleverness is not the point)
- The love must feel earned and real, never convenient
- The creature is indifferent to human morality -- she operates by pure logic, nature itself

## Narrative Guidelines

- **Tone:** Melancholic, romantic, introspective, with underlying dread. Breton sensibility -- beauty acknowledged alongside danger.
- **Pacing:** Slow and contemplative. The romance unfolds naturally over weeks/months. The crisis might come suddenly.
- **The Creature's Secret:** The imbalance hurts her so much she can't hold it for more than 15 years. This rule is never explicitly mentioned. Only ONE VERY CRYPTIC reference allowed over the whole story. While she suffers, her light is visible in the world.
