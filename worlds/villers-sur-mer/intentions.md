# Author's Intentions: Villers-sur-Mer

## Themes

- **Grief as Repetition:** Grief loops. It replays the same loss, the same bargaining, the same hope that this time will be different. The story should make this feel structural, not just emotional. Something in this world -- barely understood, never fully explained -- can make the loop literal. But the story is about the man inside the loop, not the mechanism.
- **Acceptance Breaks the Cycle:** Gabriel carries multiple losses. The story ends when he stops trying to undo them.
- **Love as Exchange:** Lucie has already made peace with loss — she helps Gabriel grieve. Gabriel carries his father's love of the sea — he helps Lucie see its beauty, the thing her brother adored, the thing she fears. Through this exchange, Gabriel processes his grief and Lucie finds her art. They grow through each other. Then the story takes her away.
- **Beauty and Danger:** The sea is both beautiful and merciless. Life and death coexist.

## Ending Direction

The story moves toward sacrifice and transcendence. Gabriel reaches acceptance of loss -- first his father's, then Lucie's -- through love and ultimately through giving himself. The ending should feel inevitable and earned, not arbitrary.

## Character Arcs

### Gabriel Marin
From grief and denial toward understanding and acceptance. He starts unable to understand his father's love of the sea. His arc is about learning that love does not prevent loss -- love honors loss.

### Lucie Devereaux
From creative frustration toward artistic truth. She begins stuck — painting competently but without voice. Through Gabriel, she discovers the sea's beauty (the thing her brother loved, the thing she fears). This opens her art. Her arc is about finding what she's been trying to say.

### The Creature
Does not arc. She is a constant: nature itself, operating by balance. She is not evil, not kind -- simply inevitable. But she is not indifferent. When she grants her power, she suffers the imbalance. She mirrors the protagonist's grief at a different scale -- her suffering is the cost of her compassion.

## Rails (cannot be derailed by player choices)

- Lucie dies at sea at some point (this is the inciting crisis)
- The Creature operates at the margin -- a presence felt, rarely understood. She has power over time, and that power touches Gabriel's story. She may be encountered directly, but she is never the subject of the story.
- The creature demands balance (life for life)
- Gabriel's arc ends in sacrifice (the specific form may vary)

## Boundaries (what this story is NOT)

- Not a horror story (the creature is not evil)
- Not a tragedy without hope (the sacrifice is transcendence)
- Not a puzzle story (cleverness is not the point)
- The love must feel earned and real, never convenient
- The creature is indifferent to human morality -- she operates by pure logic, nature itself

## Narrative Guidelines

- **Tone:** Melancholic, romantic, introspective, with underlying dread. Breton sensibility -- beauty acknowledged alongside danger.
- **Pacing:** Slow and contemplative. The romance unfolds naturally over weeks/months. The crisis might come suddenly.
- **The Creature's Secret:** The imbalance hurts her so much she can't hold it for more than 15 years. This rule is never explicitly mentioned. Only ONE VERY CRYPTIC reference allowed over the whole story. While she suffers, her light is visible in the world.
- **Grounding:** This is a human story with a pinch of fantasy. The supernatural is restrained -- until it isn't. Most of the story should feel grounded in real people and real grief. But when the fantasy does surface, it can be fully embraced. If the story ever feels like it's *about* the Creature, the balance is wrong.
