# Author's Intentions: Villers-sur-Mer

## Themes

- **Grief and Healing:** Both Gabriel and Lucie carry loss, though they are not at the same stage. Healing comes through connection and love.
- **Acceptance is Loss:** In order to escape the time loop, Gabriel must accept Lucie's death. He loses his old self doing that.
- **Love as Proxy:** Through his love for Lucie, Gabriel accepts death and makes peace with his father's death. Through her love for Gabriel, Lucie finds her true art.
- **Beauty and Danger:** The sea is both beautiful and merciless. Life and death coexist.

## Ending Direction

The story moves toward sacrifice and transcendence. Gabriel reaches acceptance of loss -- first his father's, then Lucie's -- through love and ultimately through giving himself. The ending should feel inevitable and earned, not arbitrary.

## Character Arcs

### Gabriel Marin
From grief and denial toward understanding and acceptance. He starts unable to understand his father's love of the sea. Through Lucie, he sees the sea's beauty. Through the creature, he learns that some losses cannot be prevented. Through sacrifice, he achieves redemption. His arc is about learning that love does not prevent loss -- love honors loss.

### Lucie Devereaux
From isolation toward connection through art. She begins focused on freezing time through painting. Meeting Gabriel opens her to the present. Her pursuit of artistic truth draws her toward the sea and the creature's light. She follows her art to its ultimate subject. Her arc is about the tension between capturing beauty and being consumed by it.

### The Creature
Does not arc. She is a constant: nature itself, operating by balance. Her role is to be the mechanism of consequence. She is not evil, not kind -- simply inevitable.

## Key Beats

These moments must happen in some form during the story:

1. Gabriel and Lucie meet through their shared relationship with the sea
2. They connect through shared grief and mutual artistic/emotional documentation of the mystery
3. The creature's light becomes visible as the story progresses
4. A crisis at sea where Lucie is pulled into the deep
5. The creature's law of balance is invoked
6. Gabriel faces the cost of the bargain
7. Resolution through acceptance and sacrifice

## Story Details

- The glow of the jellyfish plays a role in the reasons why Gabriel meets Lucie for the first time
- The whole story of the time loop can be considered as the process of going through loss, symbolically
- The time loop should make Gabriel's story turn into acceptance of his father's death through his acceptance of Lucie's death

## Rails (cannot be derailed by player choices)

- Lucie dies at sea at some point (this is the inciting crisis)
- The creature demands balance (life for life)
- Gabriel's arc ends in sacrifice (the specific form may vary)

## Boundaries (what this story is NOT)

- Not a horror story (the creature is not evil)
- Not a tragedy without hope (the sacrifice is transcendence)
- Not a puzzle story (the time loop serves grief processing, not cleverness)
- The love must feel earned and real, never convenient
- The creature is indifferent to human morality -- she operates by pure logic, nature itself

## Narrative Guidelines

- **Tone:** Melancholic, romantic, introspective, with underlying dread. Breton sensibility -- beauty acknowledged alongside danger.
- **Pacing:** Slow and contemplative. The romance unfolds naturally over weeks/months. The crisis might come suddenly. The time loop's duration is variable.
- **The Creature's Secret:** The imbalance hurts her so much she can't hold it for more than 15 years. This rule is never explicitly mentioned. Only ONE VERY CRYPTIC reference allowed over the whole story. While she suffers, her light is visible in the world.
- **Time Loop Mechanics:** Must be easily understandable without ANY explicit exposition. Simple but creative.
