# STORY SEED: La Lumiere Sous L'Eau

## Overview
**Title:** La Lumiere Sous L'Eau (The Light Beneath the Water)
**Duration:** 22-28 narrative turns
**Tone:** Melancholic, romantic, slow-building dread, devastating, transcendent
**Language:** French setting. Dialogue in English with French terms of place, endearment, and atmosphere. The sea should sound like the sea.

## Inciting Incident

Gabriel Marin has been living in his dead father's cliff house for months, drifting through rooms full of maritime artifacts, unable to grieve and unable to leave. He walks to the village for supplies and, passing the artist studio, sees Lucie Devereaux through the window -- paint in her hair, staring at a canvas with an expression he recognizes. Not sadness. Frustration. The look of someone searching for something they cannot name.

He doesn't speak to her. He watches for a moment, then walks on. That evening, he sits on his father's bench at the cliff overlook and watches the sea, and for the first time in months, he thinks about something other than his father.

This is not a dramatic inciting incident. It is the smallest possible beginning -- one person noticing another. The drama comes later. This is a story that earns its violence through patience.

## Story Arc

### Phase 1: Le Rivage (The Shore) -- Turns 1-12

**What happens:** Gabriel and Lucie meet, circle each other, and slowly fall in love over the course of a Breton summer. The early turns establish Gabriel's isolation and grief -- his daily ritual of walking the cliffs, his clumsy attempts to maintain his father's dinghy, his halting conversations with Madeleine at the epicerie and Kit at the cafe. Lucie exists at the village's margin too, buried in her studio, producing competent paintings that frustrate her.

Their connection begins through indirection. Gabriel visits the studio to ask Viviane about a textile repair (a sail cover of his father's). He sees Lucie's canvases -- landscapes, still lifes, nothing of the sea. He asks why. She says she doesn't paint the sea. He doesn't push. But the question opens something.

Over weeks, they begin meeting -- at first accidentally, then by design. He takes her to tidal pools at low tide and shows her what his father showed him: the miniature world in rock pools, the way light refracts in shallow water, the small crabs and anemones. She's terrified of the sea, but in knee-deep water, in sunlight, she begins to see what her brother saw. She brings her sketchbook. Her first drawings of water are tentative, shaking.

Gabriel tells her about his father's illness -- how a man who lived for sailing was trapped on land, watching the sea from a window. Lucie tells him about her brother -- how he would swim out past the breakers and float on his back, looking up at the sky, perfectly happy. She hasn't been able to paint that image. She realizes she's been painting around it for ten years.

Madeleine watches them with quiet recognition. Baptiste sees Gabriel at the harbor and says, simply: "She's good for you." Kit serves them coffee and says nothing, but cleans their table last. Sophie invites them both to a village gathering. Father Yves observes from his church door.

The romance is physical but restrained -- a hand on a shoulder, sitting close on the stone bench, a kiss at golden hour on the sandy beach. It must feel earned through accumulated small moments, not through dramatic declaration.

In the final turns of Phase 1, Lucie has a breakthrough. She takes Gabriel's dinghy (he's taught her the basics) into the rocky cove at low tide, anchors in calm water, and paints the cliffs from the sea -- the view her brother loved, the thing she's been circling for a decade. The painting is luminous, raw, true. It is the first thing she's ever painted that feels like HER. She comes back shaking, exhilarated, terrified. She tells Gabriel: "I finally understand what he saw."

**Why this happens:** Love as Exchange -- they heal each other. Gabriel processes grief through connection; Lucie finds her art through facing her fear. The audience needs to fall in love with their love before the story destroys it. Every quiet moment in Phase 1 is structural -- it's loading emotional weight for the catastrophe.

**Symbolic detail:** Lucie's canvases track the story. Early: landlocked subjects, competent but hollow. Middle: tentative water sketches, still afraid. Late: the sea painting, alive and true. The canvases are the visible record of the exchange working. They also foreshadow -- Lucie's art requires the sea, and the sea will take her.

### Phase 2: La Maree Montante (The Rising Tide) -- Turns 13-15

**What happens:** The turn before Lucie's death should feel like the happiest point in the story. She's painting constantly -- sea subjects, light on water, the view from the dinghy. Gabriel has begun sailing his father's boat properly. They spend evenings on the cliff bench. He's sleeping through the night for the first time in two years. She tells Viviane: "I think I've found it." The village has softened around them.

Then: Lucie takes the dinghy out alone one late afternoon. She wants to paint the sunset from the water -- the specific golden-hour light on the northern cliffs. She's done it before, with Gabriel. Today she goes alone, wanting this to be hers. She rows past the rocky cove, into slightly deeper water, to get the angle she wants.

The weather turns. A swell comes from nowhere -- one of those Atlantic anomalies the old fishermen know about. The dinghy capsizes in the rough water near the rocky cove. Lucie, who can swim but not well, who conquered her fear but not the sea, goes under.

Gabriel finds the overturned dinghy at dusk. Her easel is floating in the cove. The painting -- half-finished, the cliffs caught in golden light -- is face-down in the water.

The death itself is not shown. What is shown: Gabriel standing in the cove at low tide, the water to his knees, holding the ruined painting. The village behind him. The sea in front of him. And silence.

**Why this happens:** Lucie's death is the consequence of her breakthrough. The sea gave her art and took her life. Gabriel gave her the courage to face the water, and the water killed her. Beauty and Danger -- the same force, the same moment. This must feel inevitable in retrospect but devastating in the moment. The player should have no warning.

**Symbolic detail:** The ruined painting. Water-damaged, paint bleeding, the image dissolving. But not entirely destroyed -- the shapes are still visible, ghostly, like memory.

---

### Phase 3: La Descente (The Descent) -- Turns 16-18

**What happens:** Gabriel's grief collapses. He stops eating, stops leaving the house, stops speaking. The village characters try to reach him -- Madeleine brings food, Kit comes to the door, Sophie leaves notes, Father Yves sits with him in silence. Baptiste comes once, says nothing, sits for an hour, and leaves. Baptiste understands what no one else does: this grief has no floor.

Gabriel begins going to the cove at night. Standing in the water. Wading deeper. Not suicidal -- searching. He doesn't know for what. Something in the water, something his father's stories hinted at, something Baptiste's eyes seem to know.

One night -- calm, moonless, the water black and still -- he swims out past the cove, into the deep water off the northern cliffs where fishermen don't go. He dives. The cold takes his breath. He goes deeper. His lungs burn. He should surface.

He doesn't.

In the impossible moment -- water filling his lungs, consciousness fading -- light. A vast bioluminescent presence below him, rising. The Creature manifests. Time stops. Gabriel hangs suspended in cold, luminous water, breathing what shouldn't be breathable.

The Creature does not speak in words. She communicates through light, through pressure, through a resonance Gabriel feels in his chest. She shows him what she is: balance. She shows him what she can do: unmake what happened. Time can be rewound. Lucie can live again.

The price: life for life. But she does not explain clearly. She offers. She waits. Gabriel, desperate, says yes. He offers himself. He means it.

The light wraps around him. The water goes warm, then white, then nothing.

Gabriel wakes in his bed. Morning light. The cliff house. He checks the date -- it's six weeks earlier. Lucie is alive. The ruined painting doesn't exist yet because it was never painted. Everything is rewound.

But Gabriel remembers everything.

**Why this happens:** The Creature offers what grief always fantasizes about -- one more chance, the ability to undo loss. Gabriel makes the choice anyone in love would make. The horror is not in the bargain. The horror comes next.

**Symbolic detail:** The Creature's light. It is beautiful but agonized -- not the serene glow of a deep-sea creature, but something strained, as if the act of offering costs her something enormous. Gabriel sees it but doesn't understand it yet.

---

### Phase 4: Encore Une Fois (One More Time) -- Turns 19-23

**What happens:** Gabriel wakes into the second loop. He remembers everything. Lucie is alive, painting her hollow canvases, not yet knowing the sea's beauty. Gabriel has to live through it again.

This phase is compressed -- the player knows the shape of the story now, so the narrative moves faster. But within the compression, specific moments must land with devastating weight:

**The Re-Meeting:** Gabriel goes to the studio. Lucie looks up from her canvas. She doesn't recognize him -- she's never met him. He has to introduce himself again. He has to be a stranger to the woman he loves. The player sees his composure crack for just a moment before he masters himself.

**The Re-Teaching:** He takes her to the tidal pools again. She's afraid again. He shows her the rock pools again. She sketches tentatively again. But this time, Gabriel weeps. Not in front of her -- after, alone on the cliff. Because the moments are the same but subtly different. She laughs at a different crab. She uses a different shade of blue. This is not a recording. This is a new Lucie. Real. Alive. And doomed.

**The Attempt to Intervene:** Gabriel tries to change the outcome. He hides the dinghy. He invents reasons for her not to go out alone. He watches the weather obsessively. But fate has weight. The story has rails. An opportunity arises -- a perfect afternoon, Lucie's breakthrough complete, her desire to paint from the water overpowering. Gabriel can delay but not prevent. One day he's not there. She takes a borrowed boat, or walks to the cove, or finds a way. The sea takes her again.

**The Discovery in the House:** In this loop, Gabriel enters his father's study -- the room with the door that sticks. He finds, in the margins of a nautical chart, a notation in his father's handwriting. A coordinate. Beside it, in very small letters: "elle m'a tout pris et tout rendu" -- "she took everything from me and gave everything back." Gabriel stares at these words. He understands, slowly, that his father knew the Creature. That his father may have made the same bargain. That his father's disease -- the one that trapped him on land, that killed him slowly -- may have been the price.

This recontextualizes everything. His father's love of the sea wasn't just appreciation. It was debt. It was gratitude. It was a man who chose to accept his cost and live with it, watching the water that had both destroyed and saved him, until it finally took him too.

**The Second Descent:** Lucie dies again. Gabriel descends again. The Creature is waiting, but she is different -- her light is brighter, more agitated, almost painful to look at. She is suffering. The imbalance of the first reversal weighs on her. She offers again. Gabriel, knowing the cost, knowing the futility, says yes again. He can't help it. Love makes him stupid and brave and cruel all at once.

Time rewinds again.

**Why this happens:** The loop externalizes what grief does internally. Gabriel is stuck in the repetition compulsion of loss -- reliving the same love, the same hope, the same devastation. The Creature's growing pain mirrors the accumulating cost of refusing to accept death. The discovery about his father gives Gabriel the map to acceptance, but he's not ready to read it yet.

**Symbolic detail:** In the second loop, Lucie paints a slightly different version of the sea painting. Same subject, same light, but different. Because she's different. Each Lucie is real. Each Lucie dies. Gabriel is not rewinding a tape. He's killing real people by bringing them into existence to lose them.

---

### Phase 5: L'Acceptation (The Acceptance) -- Turns 24-28

**What happens:** The third loop begins. But this time, Gabriel is different. He is exhausted. He moves through the early days of the romance mechanically, then catches himself. He looks at Lucie -- this new, real, alive Lucie -- and makes a choice. Instead of trying to change the outcome, he decides to be present. Fully. For every moment.

This is the most painful phase. Gabriel knows exactly what will happen and he stops fighting it. He loves Lucie completely, knowing she will die. He shows her the tidal pools and watches her face with the desperate attention of a man memorizing someone. He sits on the cliff bench with her and doesn't look at the sea -- he looks at her. She notices. She asks why he's looking at her like that. He says: "Because you're here."

Key beats in this phase:

**Father Yves:** Gabriel goes to the priest. Not for confession -- for understanding. Father Yves tells him an old story his grandmother told him, about a light in the deep water that appears when the sea is out of balance. "My grandmother said it burns brighter the longer the debt is unpaid." He pauses. "She said it cannot burn forever." (This is the ONE cryptic reference to the 15-year limit. Father Yves doesn't understand what he's saying. Gabriel does.)

**Baptiste:** Gabriel sits with the old fisherman at the harbor. He asks: "How do you bear it? Losing your son?" Baptiste is quiet for a long time. Then: "I don't bear it. I carry it. There's a difference." Gabriel asks what the difference is. "Bearing means it gets lighter. Carrying means you get stronger." This is the wisdom Gabriel needs.

**Madeleine:** At the epicerie, Gabriel asks about his father. Madeleine says: "He loved the sea the way you love that girl -- knowing it could destroy him. He chose it anyway. Every morning, he chose it." She pauses. "That's not foolishness, Gabriel. That's faith."

**The Painting:** Lucie completes her painting again. This version. The third version. Gabriel looks at it and sees something he missed before -- in the play of light on the water, there's a shape. A glow beneath the surface. Lucie painted the Creature without knowing it. She painted what she saw -- the beauty of the sea -- and the Creature was part of that beauty.

**Lucie's Death, Third Time:** It happens. The weather turns. The dinghy capsizes. But this time, Gabriel doesn't find the overturned boat in shock. He's at the cove already, waiting. He watches the empty water come in. He picks up the ruined painting. And this time, he doesn't scream. He sits in the cove, holding the painting, and he grieves. Fully. For the first time. Not for Lucie alone -- for his father. For Baptiste's son. For Madeleine's husband. For everyone the sea has taken from everyone who loved them.

**The Final Descent:** Gabriel swims out one last time. The Creature is in agony. Her light is blinding, searing, a lighthouse of pain in the deep water. She offers again. Life for life.

Gabriel refuses.

He tells her -- not in words, but through the same resonance she uses -- that he accepts. Lucie is dead. His father is dead. The fisherman's son is dead. He accepts it all. And he offers himself. Not as payment for Lucie's return. Not as a bargain. As release. He gives his life to restore the balance that his repeated refusals have shattered. To free the Creature from the agony of holding imbalances that were never meant to be held.

The Creature's light changes. The agony drains from it. Something vast and ancient and almost tender wraps around Gabriel. He doesn't drown. He doesn't die in pain. He dissolves into the light, and in that final moment, he understands what his father understood, what Baptiste carries, what Madeleine meant by faith: love does not prevent loss. Love honors loss. And honoring loss is its own form of living.

The sea goes still. The light fades to a soft, deep-water glow -- the Creature at peace, the balance restored. Gabriel is gone.

**Epilogue:** Morning in Villers-sur-Mer. Viviane opens the studio. She finds Lucie's painting -- not the ruined one from the cove, but the completed one from the studio, the one Lucie finished the day before she died. (In the final timeline, Lucie's painting survives because Gabriel didn't take it to the cove -- he left it in the studio, knowing.) The painting is extraordinary. Light on water, cliffs at golden hour, and beneath the surface, a luminous shape that could be a jellyfish, could be a figure, could be nothing at all. Viviane stares at it for a long time.

Baptiste takes his boat out in the morning. The sea is calm. He feels, for the first time in twelve years, that the water is at peace. He doesn't understand why.

Father Yves lights a candle in the church. He doesn't know who it's for. He lights it anyway.

The cliff house stands empty. The stone bench at the overlook faces the sea, worn smooth by two generations of hands. The sea continues. Beautiful and merciless and eternal.

**Why this happens:** Acceptance is not passive. Gabriel's sacrifice is the most active choice in the story -- he chooses to stop fighting death, to honor loss instead of undoing it, to give himself so that the natural order can heal. The transcendence is real: Gabriel doesn't just die. He joins the thing his father loved. The hope is real: Lucie's painting survives, her artistic truth preserved. The village goes on. Love happened, even though it ended.

**Symbolic detail:** Three paintings, each slightly different, each destroyed except the last. The final painting -- the one that survives -- contains the Creature's image without Lucie ever knowing. Her art captured the truth of the world. Gabriel's gift to her (the sea's beauty) became her gift to the world (the painting that endures). The exchange is complete.

## Character Arcs (for this story)

### Gabriel Marin
From frozen grief to desperate love to obsessive repetition to acceptance. His arc mirrors the stages of grief made literal: denial (the loops), bargaining (the Creature's offer), depression (the mechanical third loop beginning), acceptance (the final descent). He starts unable to understand his father's love of the sea. He ends by becoming part of it. His discovery of his father's notation -- "she took everything from me and gave everything back" -- is the key that unlocks his understanding, even if he doesn't use it immediately. References `characters/gabriel-marin.md`.

### Lucie Devereaux
From creative frustration to breakthrough to death. Her arc is shorter and more tragic -- she finds her voice and loses her life in the same movement. But her arc is not wasted. The painting survives. In each loop, she finds her truth independently, proving that her art was always in her -- Gabriel just helped her look in the right direction. She doesn't arc across loops (she doesn't remember them). She arcs within each one: from fear to beauty, from competence to truth. References `characters/lucie-devereaux.md`.

### The Creature
Does not arc. But her suffering deepens across loops, creating urgency. In the first encounter, she is vast and calm. In the second, she is strained. In the third, she is in agony. Her pain is the visible cost of Gabriel's refusal to accept loss. When he finally accepts, her relief is the story's catharsis -- the restoration of balance that the world has been straining toward. References `characters/the-creature.md`.

### Baptiste (Jean-Baptiste Roux)
A mirror of Gabriel's possible future. A man who carries grief without ever resolving it, who fishes as ritual, who understands the sea's cruelty. His line -- "I don't bear it. I carry it" -- is the emotional key to Gabriel's arc. He doesn't know he's a mirror. He doesn't need to. References `characters/jean-baptiste-roux.md`.

### Father Yves Bleunard
The keeper of old stories. His cryptic mention of the Creature's light -- heard from his grandmother, half-believed -- is the single permitted reference to the 15-year limit. He represents the village's accumulated wisdom about the sea. References `characters/father-yves-bleunard.md`.

### Madeleine Kerveo
The witness. She knew Gabriel's father. Her line about his father choosing the sea every morning, knowing it could destroy him, reframes the father's story from tragedy to faith. References `characters/madeleine-kerveo.md`.

### Viviane Colas
The survivor. She finds Lucie's painting. She's the one who will carry Lucie's art forward. She represents continuity -- the world that goes on after the story ends. References `characters/viviane-colas.md`.

## Core Themes

- **Grief as Repetition Made Literal:** The time loop IS grief. Gabriel's internal experience of replaying loss is externalized by the Creature's power. The structure mirrors the emotional truth: grief repeats, and only acceptance breaks the cycle. The story is about the man inside the loop, not the mechanism.

- **The Cost of Refusal:** Each loop costs more -- the Creature suffers, a new Lucie lives and dies, Gabriel accumulates memory of loss. Refusing to accept death doesn't preserve love. It multiplies suffering.

- **Love as Exchange, Completed:** Gabriel gives Lucie the sea; Lucie gives Gabriel connection. Lucie's painting is the surviving evidence of their exchange. Gabriel's sacrifice frees the Creature. Every relationship in the story is an exchange -- and the final balance is restored when Gabriel gives without asking for return.

- **Beauty and Danger as the Same Force:** The sea gives Lucie her art and takes her life. This is not irony. It is the fundamental nature of the world: the things worth loving are the things that can destroy you. Gabriel's father understood this. Gabriel learns it.

- **Inheritance of Loss:** Gabriel inherits his father's house, his father's grief, and (he discovers) his father's relationship with the Creature. The story's deepest layer is about the patterns that repeat across generations -- and the possibility that they can be broken.

## World Departures

- Gabriel's father's connection to the Creature is implied but not established in the world files. This seed introduces it through a single discovered notation. It is kept ambiguous -- the notation could be interpreted as a figure of speech, a prayer, or evidence of a past bargain. The seed does not definitively confirm the father made a bargain. It suggests it.

- The Creature's time-reversal power is consistent with "power over time" in the intentions but extends it to a full rewind mechanism. The story treats this as rare and costly, not routine.

## Turn-by-Turn Structure

**Turn 1-2:** Gabriel alone. The cliff house, the sea, the village. His isolation established. First glimpse of Lucie through the studio window.

**Turn 3-4:** First meetings. Gabriel at the studio (the sail cover excuse). Lucie and her frustrated canvases. Viviane as social bridge.

**Turn 5-6:** Growing connection. Tidal pool visit. Lucie's first water sketches. Gabriel begins talking about his father. Village characters observe.

**Turn 7-8:** Deepening. Evenings on the cliff bench. Lucie tells Gabriel about her brother. First physical closeness. Gabriel sleeps through the night for the first time.

**Turn 9-10:** Lucie begins painting the sea. Tentative at first, then bolder. Gabriel teaches her the dinghy. Their love becomes undeniable.

**Turn 11-12:** Lucie's breakthrough. The sea painting from the water. "I finally understand what he saw." The happiest turns of the story. The village celebrates quietly -- Madeleine, Kit, Sophie, all seeing the change.

**Turn 13:** The last good day. Light and love and no warning.

**Turn 14-15:** Lucie's death. The overturned dinghy. The ruined painting. Gabriel's world ends. The village grieves.

**Turn 16-17:** Gabriel's spiral. The cove at night. The village tries to reach him. Baptiste's silent vigil. The descent.

**Turn 18:** The Creature. The offer. The choice. Time reverses.

**Turn 19-20:** The second loop. Compression. The re-meeting. The horror of watching it happen again while knowing. The attempt to intervene.

**Turn 21:** The discovery in the father's study. "Elle m'a tout pris et tout rendu." The recontextualization of everything.

**Turn 22:** Lucie dies again. The second descent. The Creature in greater pain. Gabriel chooses the loop again.

**Turn 23-24:** The third loop. Gabriel's exhaustion. His decision to be present instead of fighting. The devastating tenderness of loving someone you're about to lose.

**Turn 25:** The village wisdom. Father Yves's story. Baptiste's truth. Madeleine's faith.

**Turn 26:** Lucie's painting, completed. The shape in the water. Gabriel leaves the painting in the studio. He knows.

**Turn 27:** Lucie's death, final time. Gabriel at the cove, grieving fully. No descent in desperation. A descent in acceptance.

**Turn 28:** The final encounter with the Creature. The refusal. The sacrifice. The light. Epilogue: the village morning, the painting, the empty house, the sea.

## Notes for the Story Director

**On the Loop Structure:** The loop should NOT be announced or explained. The first reversal (Turn 18) should be disorienting -- the player should feel the whiplash of waking up in the past. Let them sit with the confusion before understanding settles in. The mechanism is never fully explained. The Creature doesn't say "I will reverse time." She offers, and reality changes. Keep it mysterious.

**On Pacing:** Phase 1 is deliberately slow. Do not rush the romance. Every small moment is structural. If the player grows impatient, that's fine -- they'll understand why later. The compressed loops (Phase 4-5) should feel increasingly urgent, claustrophobic, inevitable. The contrast between Phase 1's patience and Phase 4's compression IS the emotional engine.

**On the Player's Role:** The player is a stage director. Their most impactful moments:
- Phase 1: Shaping how Gabriel and Lucie connect (which locations, which conversations, which village characters to involve)
- Turn 14: The player may try to intervene in Lucie's death. Let them try. Let them fail. The failure must feel real.
- Phase 4: The player chooses how Gabriel navigates the loop -- does he tell anyone? Does he try to prevent the death? These choices affect texture but not outcome.
- Turn 27-28: The player is offered the choice: descend again (another loop) or accept. If they choose the loop, the Creature's agony should make the cost unbearable. Guide them toward acceptance without forcing it. If they choose acceptance, the final scene should be earned.

**On the Creature:** She is not a character to converse with. She is an experience. Her communication is light, pressure, resonance. The Director should resist the temptation to give her dialogue. She is felt, not heard. Her suffering in later loops is visible (brighter light, agitated water, a sense of strain in the deep) but never explained. The player should feel compassion for her without understanding her fully.

**On the Father's Notation:** "Elle m'a tout pris et tout rendu" is the seed's deepest buried treasure. It should be discovered, not announced. The player should have the option to explore the study, find the chart, read the margin. If they miss it, the story still works. If they find it, it gains a generational dimension that makes the ending even more powerful. Do NOT over-explain what the notation means. Let the player sit with it.

**On Grief:** This story treats grief with absolute seriousness. There is no comic relief. There is no villain. There is no clever solution. The only answer to loss is acceptance, and acceptance is the hardest thing a person can do. The Creature's loop is a mercy that becomes a prison -- exactly like the fantasies grief generates. "If I could go back. If I could do it differently. If I had one more day." The story says: you can. And it still ends the same way. Because it has to. Because that's what death is.

**On Hope:** The ending must not feel nihilistic. Gabriel's sacrifice is transcendent, not tragic. He doesn't die in despair -- he gives himself in understanding. The painting survives. The Creature is at peace. The village wakes to a calm sea. Baptiste feels something lift. These details matter. The story acknowledges sorrow and still permits love. That's what makes it true.

**On Mystery:** The following should remain unexplained:
- What exactly the Creature is
- Whether Gabriel's father truly made a bargain
- What happens to Gabriel after the light takes him
- Why the Creature sometimes responds to grief and sometimes doesn't
- The 15-year limit (one cryptic reference only, through Father Yves)

The following should be made emotionally clear even if mechanistically vague:
- The loop is real (not a dream, not madness)
- The Creature's suffering is real
- Gabriel's choice to accept is the right one
- Love happened, and it mattered, even though everyone is gone
