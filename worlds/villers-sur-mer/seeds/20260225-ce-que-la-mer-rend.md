## Inciting Incident

Lucie Devereaux has been painting the sea for the first time in her life. Over weeks of growing closeness with Gabriel Marin -- a grieving man who showed her his father's coast, who made her look at the water the way her dead brother once did -- she has finally confronted the thing she feared. Her canvases have broken open. She is painting something true.

On a calm summer afternoon, Lucie takes Gabriel's dinghy out past the harbor, alone. She wants to see the light on the water from within it -- the way a painter needs to be inside what she paints. She has overcome her fear. This is her bravest act. The sea, indifferent as always, takes her: a shifting current at the south end, a weather change no one predicted. The dinghy is found. Lucie is not.

Gabriel, who taught her to love the sea, is destroyed by the knowledge that his gift killed her.

## Story Arc

### Phase 1: Le Silence de la Maison (The Silence of the House) — Turns 1-3
**What happens:** Gabriel Marin lives alone in his father's cliff house, going through motions. He walks the coastal path, buys groceries from Madeleine, sits in the cafe. He is polite and distant. The village watches him the way small villages watch newcomers who carry visible weight. Baptiste sees him at the harbor, fumbling with a bowline on the dinghy he barely uses. Madeleine notes his sparse purchases. Kit serves him coffee and doesn't push conversation.

Gabriel encounters Lucie peripherally -- glimpsing her through the studio window, or passing her on the path. They don't connect yet. What matters is establishing the texture of Gabriel's grief: the house full of his father's things, the sea his father loved that Gabriel doesn't yet understand, the feeling of living in a dead man's life without knowing how to make it his own.

**Why this happens:** The audience must feel the weight Gabriel carries before the love story begins. The house, the sea, the father's absence -- these must be tactile and specific. The player's first choices orient the story: what does Gabriel do with his time? Who does he talk to? How close does he get to the water?

**Symbolic detail:** The father's barometer on the wall. Gabriel checks it out of inherited habit without understanding what it tells him. The needle moves, but he can't read it.

### Phase 2: La Rencontre (The Meeting) — Turns 4-6
**What happens:** Gabriel and Lucie meet properly. Not a romantic collision -- a slow convergence. Perhaps Gabriel wanders into the studio looking for Viviane (Madeleine sent him to return something), and finds Lucie instead. Or they sit at adjacent tables in Kit's cafe during a rain shower and one of them speaks. The connection is quiet and real: two private people recognizing something in each other without rushing to name it.

Lucie is stuck in her art -- working constantly, producing competent paintings that feel hollow. She talks about this if Gabriel asks, not as a confession but as a fact she lives with. Gabriel talks about his father's house, the strangeness of inhabiting someone else's life. They begin to walk together on the coastal path. Not every day. But regularly enough that the village notices.

Viviane watches with interest and a flicker of something she'd never call jealousy. Madeleine observes purchasing patterns -- Gabriel is buying food for two. Sophie sees them on the path and wonders.

**Why this happens:** The love must feel earned. It grows from shared solitude, not from dramatic attraction. They are two people who don't fill silences, and this becomes the foundation.

**Symbolic detail:** Lucie's canvases in the studio -- subjects that shift restlessly. Landscapes, still lifes, portraits, abstractions. She paints everything except the sea.

### Phase 3: L'Echange (The Exchange) — Turns 7-10
**What happens:** The core thematic movement. Gabriel takes Lucie to the cliff overlook -- his father's spot. She sees the Atlantic from above: vast, terrifying, beautiful. Gabriel tells her about his father, a man who simplified his life down to this view. Lucie tells him about her brother -- a boy who loved the water, who drowned ten years ago, whose death she has made peace with but whose joy she has never been able to touch.

The exchange: Lucie helps Gabriel grieve. Not through advice -- through example. She has done this. She knows that grief doesn't resolve; it becomes part of you. She doesn't try to fix him. She simply stays present when he hurts. Through her, Gabriel begins to feel his father's death as loss rather than as a problem to solve.

Gabriel helps Lucie see the sea. Not abstractly -- specifically. He shows her the way light moves on the water in late afternoon. He takes her to the harbor and lets her watch Baptiste prepare his boat at dawn, the economy and respect of a man who has worked this water for 50 years. He reads to her from his father's maritime books -- not poetry, but tide tables and navigation charts, the working beauty of a life oriented toward the sea.

Lucie begins to paint the sea. First tentatively -- sketches from the cliff, watercolors of the harbor. Then with increasing urgency. Her art is cracking open. She is painting the thing she has been painting around her entire life: the water that took her brother, the water her brother loved. The canvases are rough, raw, alive in a way her previous work never was.

Viviane sees the change and is shaken by it -- this is the breakthrough she has been hoping Lucie would have, and it came from someone else, not from her. The competitive edge in Viviane flares and she swallows it, because she loves Lucie and can see this is real.

The village feels the warmth. Even Baptiste, who guards his feelings like a fisherman guards his best spots, notices something shift in the air.

**Why this happens:** This is the love story's engine, but it is also the thematic trap. Everything Gabriel gives Lucie pulls her toward the sea. Her artistic truth IS the sea. The thing that saves her art is the thing that will kill her. Beauty and danger are not separate forces -- they are the same force.

**Symbolic detail:** A painting Lucie makes during this phase -- the sea seen from the cliff overlook at dusk, the water dark and luminous at the same time. It is the best thing she has ever done. She knows it. She also knows it came from standing where Gabriel's father stood, seeing what he saw. She painted it for her brother. She painted it because of Gabriel. She painted it because she finally looked at the thing she was afraid of.

### Phase 4: La Plenitude (Fullness) — Turns 11-12
**What happens:** Summer at its peak. Gabriel and Lucie are in love -- not declared dramatically, but lived. They spend nights at the cliff house. She paints in the morning light from his living room windows. He cooks badly and she doesn't mind. They walk the coastal path at dusk. The house, which was a mausoleum, becomes alive.

Lucie's art is demanding more. She wants to paint the sea from closer -- not from the cliff, but from within. She talks about going out on the water. Not recklessly -- thoughtfully. She wants to understand the light from the surface, the way the water moves when you're inside it. She has overcome her fear, and what replaced it is hunger: the painter's need to get closer to the subject.

Gabriel feels the first tremor of dread. The sea is beautiful. The sea is also where people die. But he cannot be the one to stop her -- to cage her the way his father was caged by illness. He knows this even if he can't articulate it yet.

The village: Baptiste is preparing for a weather shift he can read in the sky. Madeleine mentions to Kit that the barometric pressure has been strange. Father Yves tends his garden and feels a chill that doesn't match the temperature.

**Why this happens:** The fullness must be complete before it is shattered. The audience must be invested in this love, in Lucie's art, in the possibility that Gabriel might be okay. The dread must be structural -- felt by the audience even if the characters are too happy to notice.

**Symbolic detail:** Gabriel finds himself checking his father's barometer for the first time with actual attention. The needle has dropped. He doesn't know what it means. He doesn't ask Baptiste. He should.

### Phase 5: La Prise (The Taking) — Turn 13
**What happens:** A calm morning that shifts. Lucie goes to the harbor early, before Gabriel wakes. She takes the dinghy. She has told him she wants to paint from the water. He knew this was coming. He didn't stop her because stopping her would mean becoming the thing that keeps her from the sea.

The weather changes. Not dramatically at first -- the sky greys, the wind picks up. Baptiste, heading out on his trawler, sees the dinghy in the distance and curses the amateur who took a three-meter inflatable past the harbor mouth with weather building. He doesn't know it's Lucie. By the time the squall hits, the dinghy is too far out. The current at the south end does the rest.

The dinghy is recovered. Lucie is not. The village learns in the way small villages learn: through Madeleine, who heard from the harbor, who told Viviane, who collapsed in the studio surrounded by Lucie's paintings.

Gabriel is told by Kit, who comes to the cliff house because someone has to and Kit has the least patience for delay. The scene is not dramatic -- Kit says it plainly and Gabriel simply stops functioning. He sits in his father's chair and looks at the sea through the living room windows and understands, for the first time, what his father saw from this chair in his final months: the thing you love, the thing that is taking everything from you, the thing you cannot look away from.

**Why this happens:** The death must feel inevitable in retrospect but shocking in the moment. It must be connected to the exchange -- Lucie went to the sea because Gabriel showed her its beauty. His gift killed her. This guilt is what drives everything that follows.

**Symbolic detail:** Lucie's last unfinished canvas on the easel in the studio -- the sea, painted from memory, from the perspective of someone looking up from beneath the surface. She painted this before she went out on the water. It is the painting she was trying to verify.

### Phase 6: La Descente (The Descent) — Turns 14-15
**What happens:** Gabriel's world collapses. The village mourns. Viviane is devastated -- she has lost her friend and her studio partner, and the paintings on the walls are unbearable. Baptiste retreats into silence, recognizing the shape of this grief from his own. Madeleine, who buried a husband the same way, watches Gabriel with the sharp eye of someone who knows exactly what is coming and cannot prevent it.

Gabriel stops eating. He walks the cliff at night. He sits in the dinghy's empty spot at the harbor. He is replaying the last morning -- what he could have said, what he should have done. Grief as repetition: the same morning, the same silence, the same failure to prevent what he saw coming.

One night, Gabriel goes to the water. Not the harbor -- the open cliff. He descends the rocks, enters the sea. He is not trying to die, exactly. He is trying to follow. To go where she went. The water is cold and dark and pulls him under.

In the deep -- lungs filling, consciousness fading -- the Creature manifests. Not as a vision or a dream. As a presence so vast and ancient that Gabriel's grief, enormous to him, is a single note in a chord she has been hearing for centuries. She is moved by something in him -- not pity, but recognition. His loss resonates with something she carries, something vast and unnamed.

She does not speak in words. She communicates through pressure, through the slowing of time in the water, through a deep understanding that bypasses language. She offers: she can return him to the morning of the day Lucie died. He can live those final hours again. He can change what happens.

Gabriel accepts. He does not ask about the price. The Creature does not explain it.

**Why this happens:** The encounter with the Creature must feel like drowning and like grace simultaneously. She is not granting a wish -- she is responding to a resonance she cannot ignore. And her offer is not free: when she acts, she bears the imbalance. The cost to Gabriel will reveal itself.

**Symbolic detail:** In the deep water, Gabriel sees a faint luminescence -- not the Creature herself, but the light she carries. It is the same light old fishermen have sometimes reported seeing beneath the water at night. It has been visible for years. (This is the ONE cryptic reference to the Creature's ongoing suffering from a previous imbalance. It is never explained.)

### Phase 7: Le Premier Retour (The First Return) — Turns 16-17
**What happens:** Gabriel wakes in the cliff house. Morning light. The barometer on the wall. He knows what day it is. Lucie is asleep beside him.

He has hours before she goes to the harbor. He lives these hours in a state of desperate, terrified love -- holding her, watching her paint, memorizing the paint stains on her fingers, the way she trails off mid-sentence when her mind goes to visual problems. She notices something is different about him but attributes it to tenderness.

He prevents her death. He does it clumsily -- hides the dinghy key, suggests they stay in, invents reasons. She is confused. She wants to go to the water. He becomes insistent, almost panicked. She yields, troubled, because she can see something is wrong with him and she is not the kind of person who pushes past someone's pain.

They spend the day together. Lucie does not go to the sea. She does not die. Evening comes. Gabriel weeps with relief.

The next morning, Gabriel wakes and something is wrong. Not with Lucie -- she's alive, she's fine. But when he looks at his father's photograph on the wall, the face is slightly blurred. Not the photograph itself -- his memory. He can't quite recall the sound of his father's voice. The first thing he loved is becoming the first thing he loses.

And Lucie is different. Not dramatically -- subtly. The urgency is gone from her painting. She works in the studio but the canvases are competent again, not alive. The breakthrough is retreating. Without the sea, her art is folding back into safety. She is frustrated but can't name why. She talks about leaving the village before summer ends. The light has gone out of something.

Gabriel realizes: he saved her body but broke the exchange. By keeping her from the water, he did to her what disease did to his father. He caged the thing she loved.

**Why this happens:** This is grief as repetition made structural. Gabriel is replaying the same pattern: trying to prevent loss by controlling the thing he loves. His father's disease prevented sailing. Gabriel's fear prevents Lucie from the sea. The mechanism is different, the cage is the same. He must see this.

**Symbolic detail:** The barometer needle. On the original day, it dropped, signaling the weather change Gabriel didn't know how to read. On this replayed day, the needle is steady. The weather is fine. But Gabriel has created a different kind of storm.

### Phase 8: Le Deuxieme Retour (The Second Return) — Turns 18-19
**What happens:** Gabriel goes to the water again. Not to drown -- to ask. The Creature's presence is still there, beneath the surface, the faint light visible from the cliff at night. She gives him another morning. The price compounds: when Gabriel wakes, he cannot remember his father's hands. The rough fingers, the way they handled rope -- gone.

This time, Gabriel tries a different approach. He doesn't prevent Lucie from going to the water. He goes with her. He takes the dinghy out himself, with her. He will be there to protect her. They go out past the harbor, into the open water. Lucie is radiant -- painting from the boat, laughing at the spray, seeing the coast from the sea for the first time. It is the most beautiful morning.

But Gabriel's presence changes things. He is too careful. He watches the sky instead of the water. He steers away from where the currents run. Lucie can feel his fear through the boat. She asks him what's wrong. He cannot tell her the truth. The morning sours -- not into tragedy, but into something diminished. Lucie paints, but the paintings are cautious. Gabriel's anxiety has infected the day. They come back safe, both of them. Lucie is alive.

But the art didn't break through. The painting from the boat is good but not great. Lucie needed to be alone on the water -- not protected, not supervised, but alone with the thing she feared. Her courage is her own. No one can do it for her.

And Gabriel has lost more: he can no longer remember the name of his father's boat. The details of his father's life are eroding, the very things he came to this house to hold.

**Why this happens:** Gabriel is learning that he cannot both protect Lucie and let her be fully herself. Love is not prevention. Love is presence without control. This is what his father knew about the sea: you go out every morning knowing the sea could take you, and you go out anyway, because the going is the point.

**Symbolic detail:** On the water, for one moment, Lucie looks at the horizon and her face holds the same expression Gabriel has seen in photographs of his father at sea. The recognition is a knife.

### Phase 9: Le Choix (The Choice) — Turns 20-21
**What happens:** Gabriel walks to the harbor in the early morning, hollowed out. He sits on the bench. Baptiste arrives, as he does every morning before dawn, preparing La Bretonne. They don't speak for a long time. Baptiste works. Gabriel watches.

Eventually, something passes between them -- not words, but understanding. Two men who have lost someone to the sea. Baptiste, who has never tried to undo his son's death. Who goes back to the same water every morning. Who fishes the same grounds where Erwann drowned. Not because he has forgotten, not because he has healed, but because this is how he honors what was lost: by continuing to live in the place where it happened.

If Baptiste speaks, it is something simple and brutal. Not wisdom -- just truth. Something like: "The sea doesn't keep anything forever. But it doesn't give anything back either. You have to decide whether you're a man who goes out on the water or a man who watches from the cliff."

Gabriel makes his choice. He does not go to the Creature again. He does not ask for another morning. He wakes on the final day and lets it be.

He loves Lucie fully through the last hours. He does not hide. He does not protect. He does not cage. When she says she wants to take the dinghy out, he helps her carry it to the water. He checks the sky the way his father would have -- not with fear, but with respect. He ties her bowline properly (Baptiste taught him something, in some version of these days). He watches her go.

The weather changes. The sea does what it does. Lucie does not come back.

**Why this happens:** The point of no return. Gabriel actively helps Lucie go to the sea, knowing she will die. This is not passivity -- it is the hardest thing he has ever done. He is choosing to let the person he loves be fully herself, even though that fullness leads to death. He is choosing not to be the cage. He is choosing what his father chose every morning: the sea, knowing what the sea is.

**Symbolic detail:** The bowline Gabriel ties on the dinghy. A knot he couldn't tie at the beginning of the story. A knot Baptiste showed him. A knot his father would have tied without thinking. It holds. It doesn't save her. But it holds.

### Phase 10: Ce que la mer rend (What the Sea Returns) — Turn 22
**What happens:** Aftermath. The village grieves again -- but Gabriel's grief is different this time. It is not desperate. It is not bargaining. It is grief that knows what it has lost and does not try to undo it.

Gabriel's memories of his father are partially damaged -- some details are gone forever, the price of his bargaining. He can no longer remember his father's voice. He can no longer remember the name of the boat. But he remembers the shape of his father's life: a man who loved the sea, who went out every morning, who watched the water from his chair when he could no longer go, and who never once wished the sea away.

Gabriel stays in the house. He begins to learn the barometer. He takes the dinghy out -- not far, but out. Baptiste sees him at the harbor and nods. Nothing more is needed.

Viviane preserves Lucie's paintings. The sea canvases -- the ones that broke through -- are mounted in the studio. They are the best work Lucie ever did. They are the sea painted by someone who finally looked at it without flinching. Viviane cannot look at them without crying. She also cannot take them down.

Father Yves says a mass. The village attends. Madeleine brings food to Gabriel's house without being asked, the way she brought food to other grieving homes over 40 years. Kit pours a drink and says nothing. Sophie writes something in her journal that she will keep for years.

The Creature's light beneath the water fades. The imbalance is resolved. Not because Gabriel paid a price -- because he stopped trying to cheat the balance. Acceptance is not a transaction. It is a release.

**Why this happens:** The story earns its ending by making Gabriel's acceptance active, costly, and irreversible. He has lost Lucie. He has lost pieces of his father. He has gained understanding that cost him everything it could cost. The ending is not comfortable. But it means something.

**Symbolic detail:** The barometer on the wall. Gabriel reads it now -- not as his father's habit, but as his own. The needle says what the needle says. He goes out on the water anyway.

## Character Arcs (for this story)

### Gabriel Marin
From grief as denial to grief as acceptance. He begins living in his father's house as a form of proximity to the dead -- not processing, but preserving. Through Lucie, he learns that grief can soften without disappearing. Through losing Lucie, he learns that love does not prevent loss. Through the Creature's gift, he learns that trying to undo loss destroys the thing you're trying to save. His point of no return: actively helping Lucie go to the sea, knowing what the sea will do. His understanding of his father completes when he finally reads the barometer -- not the instrument, but the principle: you respect the sea, you read the signs, and you go out anyway.

### Lucie Devereaux
From creative frustration to artistic truth, cut short by the very thing that freed her. She begins painting competently but without voice, afraid of the subject her art needs most: the sea. Through Gabriel, she confronts the water and her art breaks open. She paints the sea -- raw, true, alive -- for the first time. Her arc completes when she takes the dinghy out alone: the painter going to her subject, the sister going to the water her brother loved. She dies at the height of her creative power, having found what she was always looking for. Her paintings survive her.

### The Creature
Does not arc. She is the constant. She manifests when Gabriel's grief resonates with something she carries. She offers her power -- time manipulation -- and bears the cost of the imbalance. When Gabriel stops trying to cheat the balance, her burden lifts. She is not punishing him. She is not teaching him. She is a force of nature that responded to a force of grief, and the equation resolves when the human stops fighting it.

### Baptiste Roux
The structural mirror. He lost his son to the same sea 12 years ago and never tried to undo it. He goes out every morning. He fishes the same waters. He is not wise -- he is stubborn. But his stubbornness is the exact quality Gabriel needs to see: the refusal to abandon the sea because the sea took something from you. Baptiste's role is small but crucial -- a conversation at the harbor that changes everything, not through eloquence but through the simple fact of his continued existence on the water.

### Viviane Colas
The witness to Lucie's art. She sees the breakthrough and feels both joy and envy. After Lucie's death, she becomes the keeper of the paintings -- the person who ensures Lucie's work survives. Her grief is specific: she lost her closest friend and she lost a version of their shared creative life. She is the character who carries Lucie's legacy forward.

### Madeleine Kerveo
The village's memory. She has seen this grief before -- she lived it when Hervé drowned 24 years ago. She does not offer wisdom. She offers soup, practical help, and the blunt acknowledgment that grief does not end, it just changes shape. She is the proof that you can lose someone to the sea and still stock the shelves every morning.

## Core Themes

**Grief as Repetition:** The Creature's gift makes the metaphor literal. Gabriel replays the same loss, the same morning, the same failure. Each repetition strips something from him. The loop is grief itself: the compulsive rewinding, the belief that if you replay it enough times you'll find the version where no one dies.

**Acceptance Breaks the Cycle:** Gabriel's arc ends not when he passively "lets go" but when he actively chooses to help Lucie go to the sea knowing she will die. Acceptance is not resignation. It is the hardest act of love in the story.

**Love as Exchange:** Lucie gives Gabriel the ability to grieve. Gabriel gives Lucie the sea. Both gifts are real and both are costly. The exchange is completed when Lucie dies -- not because her death was the price, but because her death was always where the sea was taking her, and Gabriel's love could not have been real if it tried to prevent that.

**Beauty and Danger Are the Same Force:** The sea is not separately beautiful and dangerous. The beauty IS the danger. Lucie's art comes alive because she confronts the sea. The sea that gives her art kills her. Gabriel's father loved the sea knowing this. The barometer doesn't say "don't go out." It says "this is what's coming." You go out anyway.

**The Cage:** Gabriel unconsciously replicates the cage that disease built around his father. By trying to protect Lucie from the sea, he does exactly what the illness did: prevents the person he loves from reaching the thing they love. This recognition is the turning point.

## World Departures

None. The seed operates within the established world. The Creature's time manipulation is consistent with her described power. All characters behave within their established profiles. No new characters or locations are introduced.

## Notes for the Story Director

### Tone and Rhythm
The first 12 turns should feel like a slow, warm summer -- contemplative, romantic, grounded in small specific details. The pacing mirrors the Breton coast itself: long stretches of quiet punctuated by weather changes. Let scenes breathe. The love story should feel lived-in, not narrated.

Turn 13 breaks the rhythm violently. From here, the pacing tightens. The returns (turns 16-19) should feel compressed, anxious, wrong -- Gabriel is living in borrowed time and the prose should reflect that urgency.

The final turns (20-22) return to the contemplative pace of the opening, but with devastating weight. The same rhythms, the same coast, the same house -- but everything has changed.

### What Should Remain Mysterious
- The Creature's motivations. She acts from recognition, not from logic the reader can fully map.
- The mechanics of the time returns. Gabriel wakes on the morning. How this works is not explained. The Creature's power is felt, not understood.
- What exactly Gabriel loses. His father's memories erode in specific, heartbreaking details -- a voice, a face, a name -- but the full scope of the loss is never catalogued.
- The faint light beneath the water. It is mentioned. It is not explained. (This is the ONE cryptic reference to the Creature's ongoing suffering from a previous imbalance.)

### What Should Be Explicit
- Lucie's death. Not graphic, but not euphemized. The sea takes her. The village feels it.
- Gabriel's choice in Turn 20. He helps her carry the dinghy. He ties the bowline. He watches her go. These are concrete, physical acts.
- The cost. Gabriel's lost memories should be specific enough to hurt: "He could no longer remember the sound of his father's voice" -- not abstract loss, but particular absence.

### Player Choices -- Where They Matter Most
- **Turns 1-3:** How Gabriel engages with the village sets the tone. Withdrawn vs. tentatively open.
- **Turns 7-10:** The player shapes the exchange -- what Gabriel shows Lucie, how he talks about his father, how close he lets her get.
- **Turn 12:** Whether Gabriel notices the barometer, whether he says anything about the weather. He cannot prevent what happens, but the player can feel complicit or blindsided.
- **Turns 16-18:** How Gabriel tries to change the outcome. These are the most agonizing choices -- every attempt to save Lucie has consequences the player can feel.
- **Turn 20:** The point of no return. This choice should not feel like a game mechanic. It should feel like letting go.

### The Supporting Cast
Use them as witnesses, mirrors, and grounding forces. They do not know about the supernatural elements. Their grief is human-scale and real.
- **Baptiste** is the key supporting figure. His scene at the harbor (Turn 19) should feel like the emotional spine of the story's final act. He does not give a speech. He says one or two things and they land like depth charges.
- **Viviane** carries the aftermath. Her grief for Lucie is specific and creative -- she is losing a collaborator, a friend, a shared life.
- **Madeleine** is continuity. She has survived this before. Her presence says: life goes on, and that is both terrible and necessary.
- **Kit** delivers the news in Turn 13. His bluntness is a mercy.
- **Father Yves** presides over the end. Not with answers, but with the dignity of a man who has buried too many people and still shows up.
- **Sophie** is the outside observer. Her journal entry -- unseen by the reader -- is the story being recorded by someone who will carry it forward.

### The Creature
She appears in exactly two scenes: the initial encounter (Turn 15) and the implied presence during the returns. She should feel vast, ancient, and moved by something beyond human understanding. Her light is visible from the cliff -- a faint luminescence beneath the water that the old fishermen have noticed for years. This is mentioned once, in passing, and never explained.

The Creature is not the villain. She is not the savior. She is the sea's deepest law, given a form that grieves.
