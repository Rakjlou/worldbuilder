**Duration:** 20-25 narrative turns
**Tone:** Melancholic romance with underlying dread; a story about grief becoming love, and love demanding sacrifice
**Language:** French

## Inciting Incident

Gabriel, isolated in his father's cliff house for nearly two years, begins a tentative ritual of descending to Rocky Cove at dawn to sit with his father's journals. He's searching for meaning -- trying to understand the cryptic passages about "her" in the depths.

Lucie, channeling ten years of grief into obsessive painting, observes Gabriel from the cliffs one morning. She recognizes something in his posture: a man conversing with absence, the way she does with her brother.

They first encounter each other at Sandy Beach South during the golden hour. Lucie is sketching; Gabriel is walking the shore, unable to settle. Their eyes meet. No words are exchanged, but something shifts. Both sense they are not alone in their longing for the sea.

## Story Arc

### Phase 1: Recognition (Turns 1-5)

**What happens:** Gabriel and Lucie's paths cross repeatedly (the studio, the market, the beach path). Each is drawn to the other without admitting why. Viviane notices Lucie's attention shifting; she's delighted. Madeleine notices Gabriel's mood slightly changing; she's hopeful. The Creature's light begins appearing more frequently in the deep water.

**Why this happens:** The Creature has been holding an imbalance for nearly a decade -- since Lucie's brother died in the sea ten years ago. Her imbalance, nearly unbearable, begins to manifest as visible light. Gabriel and Lucie are naturally drawn to each other because they are the only two people in Villers who understand what it means to carry the sea's weight. The Creature's stirring draws them toward her, toward the moment when her imbalance will be resolved.

**Symbolic detail:** Lucie paints the Creature's light without knowing what Gabriel searches for in his father's journals -- both are documenting the same mystery from opposite shores.

### Phase 2: Connection (Turns 6-12)

**What happens:** Gabriel and Lucie begin talking. Gabriel shares his father's journals; Lucie shares her paintings. They recognize the same mystery in both sets of works. Their love develops through mutual recognition rather than seduction. Lucie sketches Gabriel; Gabriel reads Lucie's paintings. The Creature's light grows brighter.

**Why this happens:** Each has been waiting for someone who sees what they see. Through connection, both begin healing -- Gabriel finally understands his father's love of the sea by seeing it through Lucie's eyes; Lucie begins processing her brother's death by loving someone who also understands loss. Love becomes the vehicle for grief transformation.

**Symbolic detail:** The moment Gabriel shows Lucie his father's secret journal passage and she recognizes the Creature in it -- the connection between his father's mystery and her paintings becomes undeniable.

### Phase 3: The Crisis (Turns 13-15)

**What happens:** Gabriel and Lucie plan to dive together to the Rocky Cove cave during a specific low tide. They want to see what Gabriel's father encountered, what Lucie has been painting. The night they plan to dive, the Creature's light is brilliant. Lucie enters the water and is pulled deeper, beyond her control. Gabriel descends to save her but cannot reach her.

**Why this happens:** The Creature's imbalance has reached its breaking point after ten years. Lucie, through her paintings and dreams, has been calling to the Creature unconsciously. Gabriel descends purely from love, and in that moment of desperation, he becomes the instrument through which the Creature can resolve her imbalance.

**Symbolic detail:** The Creature's light at its most brilliant -- visible from the shore, undeniable. The mechanical truth: Lucie drowns. Gabriel experiences contact with the Creature. His desperate thought crystallizes into a transaction the Creature accepts.

### Phase 4: The Time Loop (Turns 16-20)

**What happens:** Gabriel wakes in his house at dawn. Everything is as it was before the dive -- before he met Lucie. He acts differently, seeks her out again. Their relationship unfolds again, but Gabriel is haunted by knowledge of her death. He realizes he is in a loop when he wakes again at the beginning. Each loop, he remembers the previous one. He tries different choices: stopping her from diving, leaving the village, confessing everything. Nothing changes the outcome.

**Why this happens:** The Creature has given Gabriel a gift that contains a curse. He must live with the knowledge that he cannot save Lucie, that his love cannot overcome fate. Each loop, Gabriel grieves more deeply. The story becomes about acceptance, not resistance. The time loop is not punishment -- it is the Creature's version of compassion, allowing Gabriel to love fully while teaching him the hardest lesson.

### Phase 5: Acceptance (Turns 21-23)

**What happens:** After several loops, Gabriel stops fighting. On a final loop, he decides to live fully with Lucie, knowing the end. They spend months together -- painting, sailing, loving. They go to the cave together, understanding what will happen. Gabriel does not try to prevent the inevitable. He realizes that by accepting Lucie's death, he finally accepts his father's death.

**Why this happens:** Gabriel understands the Creature is not evil -- she is maintaining balance. By choosing to let go, Gabriel pays a different kind of price: he learns to live with grief rather than fighting it. He also realizes the Creature will come to collect her debt -- one life saved, one life given. He accepts this.

### Phase 6: The Resolution (Turns 24-25)

**What happens:** The final timeline holds. Gabriel and Lucie dive together to the cave one last time. Gabriel, understanding the Creature's law of balance, descends deeper into the abyss to meet her. He offers himself completely. The Creature accepts his life as payment for Lucie's. Lucie is pulled back to the surface; she survives.

**Why this happens:** Gabriel achieves transcendence through sacrifice. He does not drown -- he enters the suspended moment his father described, existing with the Creature in the deep. The ending is inevitable and earned: love demanded everything, and Gabriel gave it.

**Epilogue:** Lucie washes ashore at dawn, alive. She cannot remember Gabriel's final descent, only that he was there, then he was not. Weeks later she understands what happened. She spends her remaining life painting the Creature's light, understanding now what it took from her and what it gave. The village moves on. Father Yves knows what happened and prays for Gabriel's soul. Madeleine leaves flowers at the cliff edge, year after year.

## Character Arcs (for this story)

### Gabriel Marin
See `characters/gabriel-marin.md` for who he is. In this story, Gabriel arcs from grief/denial to understanding to acceptance to sacrifice. He starts unable to understand his father's love of the sea. Through Lucie, he sees the beauty. Through the time loop, he learns that some losses cannot be prevented. Through sacrifice, he achieves redemption -- not escaping grief, but honoring it through love.

### Lucie Devereaux
See `characters/lucie-devereaux.md` for who she is. In this story, Lucie arcs from isolation to connection through art. Her pursuit of artistic truth draws her toward the sea and the Creature's light. She follows her art to its ultimate subject. She survives, but carries the loss of Gabriel into her remaining work -- her paintings become artifacts of a love she can't fully comprehend.

### The Creature
See `characters/the-creature.md` for what she is. In this story, she does not arc. She is the mechanism of consequence. Her imbalance from Lucie's brother's death drives the plot. Gabriel's sacrifice restores her balance.

## Core Themes

- **Grief as Love:** Gabriel and Lucie enter the story broken by loss. Their love is not escape -- it is two people learning to live with grief through connection.
- **Acceptance Over Control:** Gabriel's arc is learning he cannot control fate. His growth is in acceptance: "I cannot save you, but I can love you anyway."
- **The Creature as Truth:** She represents the truth that love and loss are inseparable. She offers what is asked for, but the gift teaches what needs to be learned.
- **The Sea as Symbol:** Beautiful and merciless. It takes and it gives. It is not punishment; it is consequence.

## Notes for the Story Director

- **The love must be earned.** If the audience doesn't believe in Gabriel and Lucie's connection, the ending feels arbitrary. Their relationship is built on mutual recognition of grief, not romance tropes.
- **The time loop is grief processing.** Each repetition should feel like genuine grief -- a man learning that some losses must be accepted. Not mechanical, not a puzzle.
- **The Creature is presence, not character.** She is distant, mysterious, never fully understood. Gabriel never fully comprehends her. The mystery should remain.
- **Spare use of the Creature's light.** It grows gradually. By the crisis, it's brilliant and undeniable. Don't reveal it too early.
- **Player choices are most impactful** during Phase 2 (how the connection deepens), at the crisis moment (Phase 3), and during acceptance (Phase 5). The time loop and resolution are more deterministic.
- **The ending should feel inevitable.** When Gabriel walks into the sea, it should feel like the only path that honors what has happened.
