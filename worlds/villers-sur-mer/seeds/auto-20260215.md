# STORY SEED: La Lumiere Sous l'Eau

## Overview
**Title:** La Lumiere Sous l'Eau (The Light Beneath the Water)
**Duration:** 22-25 narrative turns
**Tone:** Melancholic, romantic, building dread; quiet devastation; Breton in its bones -- beauty acknowledged alongside the certainty of loss
**Language:** French (Breton setting, French dialogue, French narration)

## Inciting Incident

Gabriel Marin has been living in his father's cliff house for months, going through the motions of a life oriented toward a sea he does not yet understand. He meets Lucie Devereaux -- a painter afraid of the water -- and recognizes in her fear something adjacent to his own. Their connection begins not with attraction but with recognition: two people circling the same void from opposite directions.

The inciting incident is not a single event but a slow convergence. The story truly begins the first time Gabriel takes Lucie to the cliff overlook and she sees the sea the way her brother might have seen it -- vast and terrifying and beautiful -- and picks up her sketchbook instead of turning away.

## Story Arc

### Phase 1: La Maison du Pere (The Father's House) — Turns 1-3
**What happens:** Gabriel's daily existence in Villers -- the cliff house full of his father's things, the rhythms he has inherited without choosing them. He visits the epicerie, sits in Kit's cafe, walks the cliffs. Baptiste watches him handle the dinghy and cannot keep quiet: he begins teaching Gabriel basic seamanship, not from warmth but from the professional inability to watch someone do something badly. Gabriel sits on the stone bench at the cliff overlook -- his father's bench -- and watches the sea without understanding what he's watching. He is stuck, suspended between grief and a life he hasn't started living.

Lucie is introduced through the village's eyes before Gabriel meets her: Madeleine mentions the painter, Viviane's energy fills the cafe with talk of the studio, a canvas is visible through the barn window. Lucie exists in the world before she enters Gabriel's story.

**Why this happens:** The audience needs to feel the weight of Gabriel's stasis before change arrives. The village must be established as a living place, not a backdrop. Baptiste's teaching creates the thread that connects Gabriel to the sea practically, not just emotionally.

**Symbolic detail:** Gabriel finds a half-finished letter in his father's desk, addressed to no one in particular, about the color of the water at dawn. He cannot finish reading it.

### Phase 2: Le Regard (The Gaze) — Turns 4-7
**What happens:** Gabriel and Lucie meet -- unremarkably, at the epicerie or on the coastal path. She is distracted, paint-stained, not looking for connection. He is quiet, watchful. The first conversation is brief and goes nowhere. But something catches: he sees her looking at the sea with an expression he recognizes -- not his father's love, not Baptiste's competence, but fear. She is afraid of the thing her dead brother adored. Gabriel understands what it means to be haunted by someone else's love for something you cannot reach.

They begin spending time together -- not romantically, not yet. Gabriel visits the studio; Lucie is curious about the cliff house, the maritime artifacts, the shape of a life built around the sea. She asks questions about his father that no one else has asked. He shows her the cliff overlook. She sketches there -- the horizon, the rocks, the water -- but her drawings are careful, controlled, afraid.

The key exchange begins: through conversations about his father, about the sea, about what it means to love something dangerous, Gabriel articulates things he didn't know he understood. Lucie listens with the attention of someone hearing a language she almost speaks. She begins to see the sea differently -- not as the thing that killed her brother, but as the thing he loved. This is terrifying and liberating.

Viviane watches her friend change with a mix of happiness and unease. Something is shifting in Lucie that Viviane cannot follow.

**Why this happens:** The love must grow from intellectual and emotional kinship, not from attraction alone. They are drawn together because they are solving the same problem from opposite sides: Gabriel is trying to understand why someone would love the sea; Lucie is trying to stop being afraid of it. Each holds the piece the other needs.

**Symbolic detail:** Lucie sees a faint glow in the water one evening from the cliff overlook -- just a flicker, like bioluminescence. She mentions it. Gabriel hasn't noticed. She files it away.

### Phase 3: L'Ete (The Summer) — Turns 8-13
**What happens:** Gabriel and Lucie fall in love. The summer deepens around them. Long days, warm evenings, the particular Breton quality of light that makes everything look painted.

Lucie's art transforms. She begins painting the sea -- first badly, fighting her fear onto the canvas, then with increasing truth. Gabriel takes her to the sandy beach at dusk and she sees the light on the water and paints it, and something breaks open. She begins going to the rocky cove at low tide -- the treacherous, beautiful place -- and painting the cave mouth, the deep green water, the way light enters from above. Each painting is bolder, rawer, more alive than anything she has made before. She is finding her voice by facing the thing she feared.

Gabriel, watching Lucie's transformation, begins to understand his father. His father didn't love the sea despite its danger -- he loved it because it demanded his full presence. The sea does not care about you, and loving it anyway is the purest form of love there is: love without the expectation of return. Gabriel begins sailing with more confidence. He takes the dinghy out alone, sits on the water, feels the swells. He reads his father's unfinished letter again and this time he can finish it.

The village notices the change. Madeleine observes that Gabriel is buying food for two. Kit sees him laughing in the cafe. Baptiste says nothing but adjusts his teaching -- he starts showing Gabriel things you only show someone who might actually become a sailor. Father Yves watches with the quiet attention of a man who has seen many loves begin and knows they all carry risk.

One day Lucie goes to the rocky cove alone and paints the cave at low tide. When she comes back, she is different. The painting is extraordinary -- the deep water, the cave mouth, and beneath the surface, a glow she cannot explain but painted anyway. "I could see what he saw," she tells Gabriel, meaning her brother. This is the moment her art arrives. This is the painting that matters.

Sophie, observing all of this, writes something in her journal about what it looks like when two broken things mend each other.

**Why this happens:** The love must feel earned and real. It develops over weeks, through shared vulnerability, not through dramatic gestures. Lucie's artistic breakthrough is inseparable from her emotional one -- she cannot paint the sea until she stops being afraid of it, and she cannot stop being afraid of it until Gabriel shows her what love for the sea looks like. The cave painting is the fulcrum: Lucie has painted the Creature's light without knowing what it is. Her art has captured something true about the world.

**Symbolic detail:** The bioluminescent glow in the water is visible more frequently as the summer deepens. Lucie paints it. Baptiste mentions to Kit that the water has been strange lately -- glassy on windy days, a light where there shouldn't be one. Neither man dwells on it.

### Phase 4: La Tempete (The Storm) — Turn 14
**What happens:** A morning in late August. The weather has been perfect for days. Lucie wants to paint the open sea from the dinghy -- to be inside the thing, not looking at it from the shore. She has been planning this. She wants to see what her brother saw: the sea from within.

Gabriel wakes and she is already gone. The dinghy is not at the cove.

The sky changes. Baptiste sees it from the harbor -- the speed of the shift, the color of the clouds. Kit sees it from the cafe window. Gabriel sees it from the cliff overlook, standing where his father stood, and the sea below is wrong -- dark, churning, already too rough for a small boat.

Lucie does not come back.

The dinghy washes up on the rocks. Her sketchbook is found, waterlogged, pages dissolving. She is never recovered.

**Why this happens:** Lucie's death is the consequence of her bravery, not Gabriel's failure. She went to the sea because she had finally become someone who could. The thing that made her art live is the thing that killed her. This is the cruelty at the center of the story: you cannot separate the beauty from the danger. The sea does not distinguish between those who love it and those who fear it.

**Symbolic detail:** Gabriel finds one intact page from Lucie's sketchbook -- a quick study of light on water, unfinished, still beautiful. He keeps it.

### Phase 5: L'Abime (The Abyss) — Turns 15-17
**What happens:** Gabriel's world folds inward. His grief compounds -- he has now lost his father and the woman who helped him understand his father. The loss is not merely doubled; it's recursive. Every insight Lucie gave him about the sea now carries the weight of her death in it. He cannot look at the water without seeing her. He cannot look away from the water without losing her.

He withdraws completely. The cliff house becomes a tomb again -- two ghosts now instead of one. He stops going to the village. Madeleine leaves food at his door; he doesn't always bring it in. Kit saves his seat at the cafe but the seat stays empty. Baptiste goes quiet -- he recognizes this grief from the inside and knows there are no words for it.

Father Yves comes to the cliff house. Gabriel opens the door because Yves is too stubborn to leave. The priest does not offer comfort. He offers presence. He sits in the living room among the dead man's artifacts and the dead woman's last painting (the cave, the light beneath the water -- Gabriel brought it from the studio) and says nothing useful and stays for an hour and leaves. This is the most anyone can do and it is not enough.

Viviane is devastated. She lost her friend. She goes to the studio and cannot enter. She stands at the door looking at Lucie's canvases -- the whole arc of a life's work, from careful competence to fierce truth, ending in the extraordinary cave painting that now belongs to Gabriel. She doesn't cry. She goes back to her loom.

Gabriel sits at the cliff overlook at night. He stares at the water. He begins to understand the most terrible thing: his father's final months, sitting in the living room watching the sea, were not devotion. They were the same thing Gabriel is doing now. His father was watching the thing that had taken everything from him and being unable to look away.

**Why this happens:** The grief must be felt, not summarized. The village's response -- each person reacting according to their nature -- grounds the loss in community. Gabriel's realization about his father deepens the thematic resonance: grief is repetition, and Gabriel is now repeating his father's pattern without having learned anything from it.

### Phase 6: La Creature (The Encounter) — Turn 18
**What happens:** A night in September. Gabriel goes down to the rocky cove. The tide is high and rising. The cave mouth is half-submerged, dark water surging in and out. He doesn't plan what happens next. He wades into the water. It is cold, shockingly cold, and the current pulls at his legs. He goes deeper. The water rises past his waist, his chest, his shoulders.

He is not trying to die. He is trying to go where she went.

Beneath the surface, in the suspended moment between breath and drowning, the Creature appears. Not as a vision but as a presence -- vast, luminous, filling the dark water with slow-pulsing light. The jellyfish form is immense and translucent, and Gabriel understands immediately that what he is seeing is only the nearest edge of something much larger.

Time stops. His lungs should fail. They do not.

The Creature does not speak in words. She communicates in resonance -- a deep, bone-level understanding that bypasses language. She recognizes Gabriel's grief. Not because she is kind, but because something in his despair resonates with something she carries -- ancient, vast, the accumulated weight of every imbalance she has borne.

She offers: the summer can be undone. Time can fold. Gabriel can return to the beginning, to before Lucie. He will carry what he knows. The summer will unfold again -- but he will be inside it differently, and the summer will respond to his difference.

Gabriel asks: what is the price?

The Creature does not answer in a way he can understand. She communicates something about weight, about carrying, about a pain that will not diminish. Gabriel does not understand what he is agreeing to. He agrees.

**Why this happens:** The Creature acts because she is moved -- not by Gabriel's suffering specifically, but by its resonance with whatever she carries. She is not saving him. She is responding to a frequency of grief she recognizes. The price is deliberately opaque: Gabriel doesn't know what he's paying, and neither does the audience. This preserves the Creature's alien logic while keeping her from becoming a plot device.

### Phase 7: Le Deuxieme Ete (The Second Summer) — Turns 19-23
**What happens:** Gabriel wakes in the cliff house. It is early June. The light is the same. The house is the same. His father's things are unchanged. But Gabriel remembers everything.

The summer begins again. He meets the same people, has the same early encounters. But he is different, and the world responds to his difference. He is not the same halting, closed man who arrived in Villers before. He carries knowledge, and it shows -- in his eyes, in the way he moves, in the weight of his attention.

He meets Lucie. She senses something in him immediately -- an intensity, a familiarity that should not exist between strangers. She is unsettled. But she is also drawn, more quickly than before, because this version of Gabriel is not stumbling toward understanding. He already understands. And understanding is magnetic.

The second summer unfolds faster, differently. Gabriel doesn't need Baptiste's lessons -- he already knows. This confuses Baptiste, who cannot explain why this amateur handles the dinghy like someone who has been taught. The village conversations are different because Gabriel responds differently. Madeleine notices he is buying food for two before there is a two. Kit observes him watching the door of the cafe with the expression of someone expecting someone.

Lucie and Gabriel fall in love again -- but the texture is different. In the first summer, their love grew from mutual discovery. In the second summer, Gabriel's foreknowledge creates an asymmetry that Lucie can feel but not name. He knows things about her she hasn't told him. He anticipates her thoughts. This is intimate and also eerie. Lucie pulls back at moments, then returns, unable to resist the feeling that this man sees her completely.

The critical difference: Gabriel tries to change the outcome. He teaches Lucie about the tides, about weather, about what Baptiste taught him. He is more careful with the dinghy. He watches the sky with the paranoia of someone who has seen a storm he cannot unsee. When Lucie begins painting at the rocky cove, he goes with her. When she talks about painting from the water, he deflects, changes the subject, suggests painting from the cliff instead.

And her art suffers. Not dramatically -- she is still talented, still searching, still finding moments of truth. But the ferocity is dampened. The breakthrough doesn't come in the same way. The cave painting, when she makes it, is beautiful but not the same -- the light beneath the water is there (brighter, in fact -- the Creature is bearing the weight of the reversal and her glow is stronger) but Lucie's hand on the brush is guided by fear rather than freedom. Gabriel's protectiveness has reintroduced the fear he was trying to save her from.

He realizes, with horror, what is happening. He is killing the thing he loves about her in order to keep her alive. He is choosing a living, diminished Lucie over a fully alive Lucie who will die. And he does not have the right to make that choice.

**Why this happens:** The second summer tests the story's central question. Gabriel's knowledge gives him power but not the right kind. He cannot protect Lucie without controlling her, and he cannot control her without diminishing her. The asymmetry of his foreknowledge mirrors the fundamental asymmetry of grief: you know what you've lost, and you cannot communicate that knowledge to anyone who hasn't lost the same thing. The second summer is Gabriel learning that love is not protection. Love is presence.

**Symbolic detail:** The bioluminescent glow beneath the water is stronger in the second summer -- visible even in daylight from certain angles. Lucie is drawn to it more urgently. She paints it compulsively. Baptiste mentions to Kit that he hasn't seen the water like this in years, and something in his face suggests he is remembering a story his grandmother told him.

### Phase 8: Le Choix (The Choice) — Turns 24-25
**What happens:** Gabriel stops trying to change things. He releases his grip on the summer. He stops watching the weather with dread. He stops steering Lucie away from the water. He lets her go.

Lucie feels the change immediately. Something in Gabriel has loosened, and it frees her. She goes to the rocky cove alone. She takes the dinghy out. She paints with the ferocity that was missing. Her art blazes back to life. She produces the cave painting again -- and this time it is even more extraordinary than before, because the light beneath the water is stronger, and Lucie has painted it with the full force of someone who is no longer afraid.

She tells Gabriel: "I could see what he saw." The same words. The same light in her eyes. Gabriel holds her and says nothing and carries what he knows.

These are the last good days. Gabriel lives them with a presence and attention that Lucie notices and does not fully understand. He looks at her the way his father looked at the sea in his final months -- not with longing but with the desperate attention of someone trying to memorize something before it's taken.

Madeleine sees it. She has seen grief in many forms, and she recognizes what she is looking at even though she cannot explain it: a man grieving something that hasn't happened yet. She says nothing. She adds extra bread to his bag.

**Why this happens:** Gabriel's release is the pivot of the story. When he stops trying to prevent the loss, the summer comes alive -- but the cost is that the loss is now inevitable. This is the mechanism by which the themes converge: grief as repetition (he is living through the summer again), acceptance breaks the cycle (he chooses to stop fighting), love as exchange (he gives Lucie back her freedom and receives the full, devastating beauty of their time together), beauty and danger (the art and the death are inseparable).

### Phase 9: L'Acceptation (Acceptance) — Turns 26-27
**What happens:** The storm day arrives. Gabriel knows the date. He has known it since the morning he woke in June.

Lucie wants to paint from the dinghy. The open sea. The thing she has been working toward all summer. She is not afraid. She is incandescent.

Gabriel does not try to stop her.

He gets in the dinghy with her.

They go out together. The morning is calm. Lucie paints. Gabriel watches her paint and watches the sky and holds both truths -- the beauty and the danger -- in his hands at the same time.

The sky changes. Gabriel sees it. He tells Lucie they need to go in. She wants five more minutes. The swells are building. Gabriel rows. The weather is faster than he is.

The storm hits. The dinghy is not built for this. The waves are steep and the wind is violent and the shore disappears behind walls of water. Gabriel fights the oars. Lucie holds her canvas. The dinghy capsizes.

In the water, in the chaos, Gabriel reaches for Lucie. Their hands connect. The water pulls them apart. He sees her face -- not afraid, not resigned, but awake, fully awake, alive in the last seconds of her life in a way that proves everything she became this summer was real. Then the sea takes her.

Gabriel is thrown against the rocks of the northern cove. He survives. His body is broken -- ribs, shoulder, a gash along his temple -- but he is alive. Baptiste and Kit pull him out of the water. He lies on the rocks and looks up at the sky and says nothing.

He understands now what the price was. Not a specific thing taken. The price is what the Creature showed him through the repetition: that love does not prevent loss. That his father's love of the sea was not denial but the most honest thing about him. That loving someone who will die -- which is everyone, which is always -- requires you to be present to the beauty and the danger at the same time, without trying to separate them.

He does not go back to the Creature. The cycle breaks.

**Why this happens:** The ending is not passive. Gabriel does not let Lucie die from the shore. He goes with her. He chooses presence over protection. He is IN the water when the storm comes. He fights to save her and fails, and the failure is not his fault and not the point. The point is that he was there. His father's love of the sea was the same -- not denial but presence. Loving something that can destroy you is the price of being fully alive.

The Creature, in the deep, feels the weight shift. The imbalance resolves -- not because a debt was paid in any ledger, but because something in the human world has settled into a truth the Creature recognizes. Her suffering eases. The light beneath the water dims.

## Character Arcs (for this story)

### Gabriel Marin
From grief and denial through desperate bargaining to acceptance. Gabriel begins unable to understand his father's love of the sea. Through Lucie, he begins to understand. Through losing Lucie, he is given the chance to undo the loss -- and through the second summer, he learns that undoing the loss means undoing the love. His arc is completed not when he accepts Lucie's death, but when he gets in the dinghy with her: when he chooses to be present to love and danger at the same time, the way his father was, the way Lucie was.

Reference: `characters/gabriel-marin.md` -- his starting state (stuck, grieving, unable to understand the sea) is the foundation for everything that follows.

### Lucie Devereaux
From creative frustration and fear toward artistic truth and courage. Lucie's arc is about finding what she has been trying to say -- and discovering that the answer lives in the thing she feared most. Through Gabriel, she sees the sea as her brother saw it. Her art comes alive when she stops painting around her fear and paints through it. Her death is not a punishment for courage; it is the consequence of being the kind of person who eventually faces the thing she fears. Her agency is paramount: she chooses the sea, and the story respects that choice.

Reference: `characters/lucie-devereaux.md` -- her creative frustration and fear of the sea are the engine of her arc.

### The Creature
Does not arc. She acts when Gabriel's grief resonates with her own ancient burden. She offers the reversal not from kindness but from recognition. She bears the cost of the imbalance -- the second summer exists because she is suffering for it. Her light, visible throughout the story, is the quiet evidence of her pain. When Gabriel accepts and the cycle breaks, her burden lifts.

Reference: `characters/the-creature.md` -- her alien logic, her resonance with human grief, her suffering.

### Jean-Baptiste Roux (supporting)
Baptiste's role is small but essential. He is the mirror of Gabriel's grief -- a man who lost his son to the sea and went back to the water anyway. He teaches Gabriel seamanship not from warmth but from professional pride, and in doing so gives Gabriel the practical competence that becomes the vehicle for his emotional journey. In the second summer, Baptiste is confused by Gabriel's sudden skill but respects competence too much to question it.

### Viviane Colas (supporting)
Viviane is Lucie's closest witness. She sees her friend transform and cannot follow her into the transformation. After Lucie's death (both times), Viviane inherits the studio and the canvases -- the record of a life's work that ended too soon. She is the character who carries the grief that isn't the protagonist's, the reminder that loss ripples outward.

### Madeleine Kerveo (supporting)
Madeleine is the village's eyes. She notices everything: Gabriel buying food for two, Gabriel grieving before the loss, the subtle wrongness of the second summer. She never understands what she is seeing, but she responds with the practical compassion of someone who has survived her own losses. She represents the village's capacity to hold grief without comprehending it.

## Core Themes

- **Grief as Repetition:** Made literal through the Creature's gift. Gabriel lives the same summer twice, and the repetition teaches him what linear time could not: that the loss was always coming, and the only choice was how to be present to it.

- **Acceptance Breaks the Cycle:** Gabriel's arc moves from bargaining (the first encounter with the Creature) to acceptance (choosing not to return to her). The cycle breaks not when Gabriel stops feeling grief, but when he stops trying to undo it.

- **Love as Exchange:** Gabriel and Lucie heal each other -- he gives her the sea, she gives him understanding. But the exchange is not symmetrical. What Gabriel gives Lucie (courage to face the sea) leads to her death. What Lucie gives Gabriel (understanding of his father) leads to his transformation. Love as exchange means love carries cost, and the cost is not evenly distributed.

- **Beauty and Danger Are Inseparable:** The sea is both the thing that makes Lucie's art live and the thing that kills her. Gabriel's choice to get in the dinghy -- to be present to both beauty and danger -- is the story's thesis statement.

- **Love Does Not Prevent Loss -- Love Honors Loss:** The final understanding, inherited from Gabriel's father and confirmed through the second summer.

## World Departures

None significant. The story stays within the established world. The Creature's time-reversal ability is consistent with her described powers ("the boundary between life and death is not as fixed as they believed" and her power over time). The bioluminescent light visible during her suffering is consistent with the Creature's secret.

## Notes for the Story Director

### Tone and Atmosphere
The first summer should feel like falling in love with a place and a person simultaneously. The prose should be sensory -- salt air, wet canvas, coffee in the morning, the sound of the sea at night. The romance is unhurried. Let the reader inhabit the world before anything breaks.

The grief sections (Turns 15-17) should be unbearable. Do not rush through them. The village's response -- each character reacting in their specific way -- is what makes the loss feel real. This is not a plot point; it is a devastation.

The second summer should feel wrong from the beginning. Not supernaturally wrong -- humanly wrong. Gabriel knows too much. His behavior is subtly off. Other characters sense it without understanding it. There should be a growing unease beneath the surface of a seemingly beautiful summer.

### What Should Remain Mysterious
- The Creature's full nature and motivations. She appears once. She does not explain herself.
- The exact price Gabriel pays. It should become clear through the story's events, not through exposition.
- Whether the second summer is "real" in the way the first was. The story should not answer metaphysical questions about time.
- The bioluminescent light. Characters notice it but never explain it. Only the cryptic reference allowed by the rules should appear: Baptiste might say something once, obliquely, about his grandmother's stories, about a light that appears when the sea is holding something it shouldn't.

### What Should Be Explicit
- Lucie's agency. She chooses the sea. Both times. This is not something that happens to her.
- Gabriel's internal struggle in the second summer. The audience must feel the weight of his foreknowledge.
- The moment Gabriel stops trying to change things. This is the emotional climax, not the storm.
- Gabriel getting in the dinghy. This is the thematic climax. He does not watch from the shore. He goes with her.

### Player Choices -- Most Impactful Moments
- **Turn 3-4:** How Gabriel and Lucie first connect. The player can shape the texture of their early relationship.
- **Turn 13:** The cave painting. The player can choose how to frame this breakthrough moment.
- **Turn 14:** The storm day (first summer). This is a rail -- Lucie dies -- but the player shapes Gabriel's experience of the loss.
- **Turn 18:** The encounter with the Creature. The player cannot refuse (Gabriel is too desperate), but they can shape his emotional state going in.
- **Turn 21-22:** The critical period where Gabriel tries to change the outcome. The player's choices here determine how far Gabriel goes in trying to protect Lucie and how sharply the consequences land.
- **Turn 24:** The release. The player chooses when and how Gabriel stops fighting. This is the most important choice in the story.
- **Turn 25:** The dinghy. The player can shape this moment but cannot prevent the storm or Lucie's death. The question is not what happens but how Gabriel faces it.

### Pacing
Slow and contemplative in Phase 1-3. The love story earns its space. The crisis (Turn 14) should feel sudden -- the pacing shifts from languid to violent in a single turn. The grief phase is slow again, heavy. The Creature encounter is suspended, timeless. The second summer moves faster -- partly because Gabriel knows the rhythms already, partly because the audience does too. The final turns accelerate toward the storm with the inevitability of a wave building offshore.

### The Creature's Cryptic Reference
One and only one oblique reference to the Creature's secret (she cannot hold the imbalance for more than 15 years) is permitted across the entire story. Suggested placement: when Baptiste mentions the light in the water during the second summer, he might say something like "My grandmother said the sea holds its debts close. Fifteen years, she said, no more than that. Then the sea settles." He shrugs it off. He does not believe it, exactly. But he remembers it.

### The Paintings
Lucie's paintings are a physical record of her arc. Her canvases should be described as the story progresses -- from competent but lifeless early work to the fierce, alive sea paintings. The cave painting (the light beneath the water) is the centerpiece. In the second summer, the cave painting should be described differently -- same subject, different energy, reflecting the changes in Lucie created by Gabriel's interference and then his release. After Lucie's death, the paintings remain. Art outlives the artist. This is part of the story's answer to grief: something survives.
