# Villers sur Mer: World Lore

## Setting & Geography

**Villers sur Mer** is a small coastal village of approximately 50 residents, located on the dramatic western coast of Brittany, France. The village clings to cliffs overlooking the Atlantic, where granite rocks meet cold, restless water.

The landscape is quintessentially Breton: moody, beautiful, dangerous. The coast features:
- Dark granite cliffs rising 30-50 feet above the water
- Tidal pools and sandy coves accessible during low tide
- Natural caves worn into the cliff face
- A rocky harbor with weathered fishing boats
- Wild grass and sparse vegetation clinging to coastal stone

West Brittany is known for frequent rain and grey skies, but this is summer -- mostly kind weather with long daylight.

## The Village

The village clusters around a small central square containing:
- **Madeleine's epicerie** (grocery shop)
- **Cafe de la Mer** (local gathering place)
- A small **stone church** with the **rectory** beside it
- Scattered cottages housing fishermen, retirees, and year-round residents

A converted **stone barn** at the village's southern edge serves as a shared artist studio.

**Gabriel's house** sits isolated on the northern cliff, a 15-minute walk from the village center. Connected by a narrow winding path, it's functionally separate -- the last inhabited place before the edge of the world.

## The Sea & Its Mystery

The sea here is both beautiful and merciless. Locals respect it. Tourists underestimate it.

Among the old folks of Villers, there are whispered stories of something dwelling in the deepest waters -- a presence, ancient and vast. The stories are vague and contradictory: a shimmer in the darkness, a light where no light should be, a feeling of being seen by something immense. Most dismiss the tales. A few do not. The stories are not widely discussed -- they belong to the oldest generation, told in low voices after too much wine, half-believed even by those who tell them.

### On Gabriel's Father

Gabriel's father loved the sea deeply. Even after illness prevented him from sailing, he remained connected to the water -- walking the cliffs, watching the tides, sitting for hours at the overlook. He spent his final years in quiet communion with the ocean, and whatever peace he found there, he took with him. Father Yves remembers him as a man who understood something about the sea that most people didn't -- though what that was, he could never quite articulate.

## Time & Season

This is a **summer tale**. The story unfolds across months when the days are longest and the sea is most seductive. The good weather makes it possible to love the coast, possible to take to the water, possible to forget the sea's danger.

## The Logic of the World

**Magic is real but invisible.** It does not announce itself. The Creature is not a myth everyone discusses -- she is a whispered legend among old folks, a half-believed story. She has manifested in the far village past but its existence is more of an unknown folk tale than a real topic.

**Grief is real.** Both Gabriel and Lucie are broken in ways that healing requires -- connection, witnessing, love. The world permits this healing, but not without cost.

**Fate and choice coexist uneasily.** Gabriel will have agency in how he lives. But some losses cannot be prevented, no matter how cleverly he chooses.

## Current Situation

Gabriel is living in his late father's house, trying to honor his father's love of the sea. He does not yet understand the sea. He reads his father's journals and maritime books, looking for the understanding his father seemed to possess.

Lucie is channeling her soul through painting. She lost her brother to the sea ten years ago and has found a kind of peace in trying to stop time in her paintings. She paints obsessively -- the sea in all its moods, moments she wants to preserve, the light on water. The sea fascinates and frightens her in equal measure.

They live in the same small village but have not yet met. Both carry grief. Both are drawn to the water. Both are searching for something they cannot name.

## Atmosphere & Tone

- **Melancholic**: The weight of loss hangs over everything
- **Romantic**: But hope persists in small moments -- light on water, a stranger's eyes, the possibility of connection
- **Introspective**: Long moments of silence, internal struggle, watching and waiting
- **Underlying dread**: The knowledge that beautiful things can end, that the sea takes what it wants, that love demands payment
- **Breton sensibility**: Practical people in a beautiful, harsh place, respectful of forces beyond control

The world is not dark, but it is not naive. It acknowledges sorrow and still permits love. This is what makes it true.
