# Villers sur Mer: World Lore

## Setting & Geography

**Villers sur Mer** is a small coastal village of approximately 50 residents, located on the dramatic western coast of Brittany, France. The village clings to cliffs overlooking the Atlantic, where granite rocks meet cold, restless water.

The landscape is quintessentially Breton: moody, beautiful, dangerous. The coast features:
- Dark granite cliffs rising 30-50 feet above the water
- Tidal pools and sandy coves accessible during low tide
- Natural caves worn into the cliff face
- A rocky harbor with weathered fishing boats
- Wild grass and sparse vegetation clinging to coastal stone

West Brittany is known for frequent rain and grey skies, but this is summer -- mostly kind weather with long daylight.

## The Village

The village clusters around a small central square containing:
- **Madeleine's epicerie** (grocery shop)
- **Cafe de la Mer** (local gathering place)
- A small **stone church** with the **rectory** beside it
- Scattered cottages housing fishermen, retirees, and year-round residents

A converted **stone barn** at the village's southern edge serves as a shared artist studio.

**Gabriel's house** sits isolated on the northern cliff, a 10-minute walk from the village center. Connected by a narrow winding path, it's functionally separate -- the last inhabited place before the edge of the world.

## The Sea & Its Mystery

The sea here is both beautiful and merciless. Locals respect it. Tourists underestimate it.

Deep in the water lives **the Creature** -- a god-like entity, calm and detached as the concept of fate itself. She appears as a shimmering jellyfish-like figure of light, beautiful and terrible in equal measure. But she dwells in the deepest waters and does not rise to the surface. To see her, one must descend -- diving into the depths, drowning and sinking, or being pulled down by desperate need.

The encounter happens underwater, in a suspended moment outside time: water fills the lungs, breath should fail, but does not. The person hangs there in the deep with her light surrounding them, unable to breathe but not drowning. This is the tiny fantasy, the magic at the heart of the world -- the impossible conversation in the abyss.

### On Gabriel's Father

There is a connection between Gabriel's father and the Creature. **Did he seek her, descending into the deep water when illness took his ability to sail? Or did she call him down -- some rare quality that drew her vast attention?** His journal contains fragments: *"I descended into the deep and she was there -- a shimmer of light, a jellyfish made of stars. I should have drowned, but she held me in that moment. I couldn't breathe but didn't need to."* And then: *"Did I seek her, or did she call me down? I cannot know."*

The truth is unknowable, and perhaps both are true. Whether their connection began in his desperation or in her curiosity, whether he was chosen or whether he sought, remains a mystery Gabriel inherits but cannot solve. Father Yves knows legends his old relatives told of something ancient dwelling in the deepest waters. Gabriel's father lived in love with the sea, even when illness prevented him from sailing.

**Whether his father sought her or she was drawn to him, whether their connection was born of desperation or recognition, Gabriel cannot know. But the connection existed, and through it, she sees Gabriel as more than just another human calling from the shore.** This kindness is not salvation -- it is witness. She sees him, knows him, understands his longing.

## Time & Season

This is a **summer tale**. The story unfolds across months when the days are longest and the sea is most seductive. The good weather makes it possible to love the coast, possible to take to the water, possible to forget the sea's danger.

## The Logic of the World

**Magic is real but invisible.** It does not announce itself. The Creature is not a myth everyone discusses -- she is a whispered legend among old folks, a half-believed story. She has manifested in the far village past but its existence is more of an unknown folk tale than a real topic.

**Grief is real.** Both Gabriel and Lucie are broken in ways that healing requires -- connection, witnessing, love. The world permits this healing, but not without cost.

**Fate and choice coexist uneasily.** Gabriel will have agency in how he lives. But some losses cannot be prevented, no matter how cleverly he chooses.

## Current Situation

Gabriel is living in his late father's house, trying to honor his father's love of the sea. He does not yet understand the sea. He watches the sea for signs of something beyond the ordinary -- a presence, a meaning, something vast that he cannot name.

Lucie is channeling her soul through painting. She has lost her brother to the sea ten years ago and now has found peace in trying to stop time in her paintings. She paints every moment she wants to remember for any reason, with a specific thing for the sea because her brother was afraid of it.

They both watch the sea. They both sense the weight of something ancient in the depths. And they are both about to discover that the sea is not just beautiful -- it is alive, aware, and it remembers those who love it.

## Atmosphere & Tone

- **Melancholic**: The weight of loss hangs over everything
- **Romantic**: But hope persists in small moments -- light on water, a stranger's eyes, the possibility of connection
- **Introspective**: Long moments of silence, internal struggle, watching and waiting
- **Underlying dread**: The knowledge that beautiful things can end, that the sea takes what it wants, that love demands payment
- **Breton sensibility**: Practical people in a beautiful, harsh place, respectful of forces beyond control

The world is not dark, but it is not naive. It acknowledges sorrow and still permits love. This is what makes it true.
