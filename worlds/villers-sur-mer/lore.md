# Villers sur Mer: World Lore

## Setting & Geography

**Villers sur Mer** is a small coastal village of approximately 50 residents, located on the dramatic western coast of Brittany, France. The village clings to cliffs overlooking the Atlantic, where granite rocks meet cold, restless water.

The landscape is quintessentially Breton: moody, beautiful, dangerous. The coast features:
- Dark granite cliffs rising 30-50 feet above the water
- Tidal pools and sandy coves accessible during low tide
- A rocky harbor with weathered fishing boats
- Wild grass and sparse vegetation clinging to coastal stone

West Brittany is known for frequent rain and grey skies, but this is summer -- mostly kind weather with long daylight.

## The Village

The village clusters around a small central square containing:
- **Madeleine's epicerie** (grocery shop)
- **Cafe de la Mer** (local gathering place)
- A small **stone church** with the **rectory** beside it
- Scattered cottages housing fishermen, retirees, and year-round residents

A converted **stone barn** at the village's southern edge serves as a shared artist studio.

**Gabriel's house** sits isolated on the northern cliff, a 15-minute walk from the village center. Connected by a narrow winding path, it's functionally separate -- the last inhabited place before the edge of the world.

## The Sea & Its Mystery

The sea here is both beautiful and merciless. Locals respect it. Tourists underestimate it.

Among the old folks of Villers, there are stories. They don't agree on what the stories are about. Something in the water, something old. The details shift depending on who tells them and how much wine has been poured. Most people dismiss them entirely. A few do not. The stories are not widely discussed -- they belong to the oldest generation, and even those who tell them aren't sure what they believe.

## Time & Season

This is a **summer tale**. The story unfolds across months when the days are longest and the sea is most seductive. The good weather makes it possible to love the coast, possible to take to the water, possible to forget the sea's danger.

## The Logic of the World

**Magic is real but quiet.** It does not announce itself -- until the moment it does. The Creature is not a myth everyone discusses -- she is a whispered legend among old folks, a half-believed story. She has manifested in the far village past but her existence is more of an unknown folk tale than a real topic. When the supernatural does surface, it can be undeniable -- but those moments are rare, and the world returns to its human rhythms after.

**Grief is real.** Gabriel carries grief he hasn't processed. The world permits healing -- through connection, witnessing, love -- but not without cost.

## Current Situation

Gabriel is living in his late father's house on the northern cliff. He came here to be close to his father. He walks the coast, sits in the rooms, lives among his father's belongings.

Lucie is painting constantly, searching for something in her work she hasn't found yet. She lost her brother ten years ago and has made her peace with it. She paints in part to honor him — to preserve moments, to freeze time. But her art hasn't come alive yet, and she knows it.

## Atmosphere & Tone

- **Melancholic**: The weight of loss hangs over everything
- **Romantic**: But hope persists in small moments -- light on water, a stranger's eyes, the possibility of connection
- **Introspective**: Long moments of silence, internal struggle, watching and waiting
- **Underlying dread**: The knowledge that beautiful things can end, that the sea takes what it wants, that love demands payment
- **Breton sensibility**: Practical people in a beautiful, harsh place, respectful of forces beyond control

The world is not dark, but it is not naive. It acknowledges sorrow and still permits love. This is what makes it true.
