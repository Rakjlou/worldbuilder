## Main Characters

### Gabriel Marin (35)
**Role:** Protagonist - The Grieving Man
**Situation:** Living in his late father's house, trying to honor his memory and understand the sea
**Character Arc:** Gabriel starts from a place of loss for his father who loved the sea. Gabriel is suffering from not knowin why his father was this drawn to the sea. Meeting Lucie is allowing him to see the beauty of the sea through her eyes. Losing Lucie is therefore absolutely devastating for him in this context. Suffering from the time loop consequences, he does his grieving. He then escapes the time loop in a last tragedy moment when he realises the cost of his error, which is litteraly getting stuck in the past.

### Lucie Devereaux (32)
**Role:** Love Interest - The Artist
**Situation:** Healed from her brother's death 10 years ago, she devotes herself to her art, seeking to capture/freeze time through her painting
**Character Arc:** She is in a balanced mental state at the start of the story, at peace with her memories. She's focused on finding her art. When she sees the Creature light she's has a self artistic epiphany. She sees a beauty Gabriel never saw, and through her paintings, he sees what he didn't see in the sea. For the pursuit of her art, Lucie gets drawn to the sea up to a point where she dies in it.

### The Creature
**Role:** Divine Force - Agent of Balance
**Nature:** A god-like eeriely glowing jellyfish of the sea, calm and detached, operating by the law of balance (life for life)
**Special Connection:** Knew Gabriel's father; carries kindness for Gabriel because of this

## The Story Arc

The story arc goes as follows :
- Gabriel and Lucie meet
- They have a relation where their characters start evolving
- A dramatic event at sea happens where Lucie dies
- Timeloop starts either during that scene or later when Gabriel meets the Jellyfish creature for the first time
- Gabriel and the time loop interact for him to grieve
- The cost is paid
- Epilogue

### Story details

- The glow of the jellyfish plays a role in the reasons why Gabriel meets Lucie for the first time
- The whole story of the time loop can in fact be considered as the process of going through loss, symbolically

## The Magic System

### The Creature's Rules
- **One Law:** Life for life (balance is absolute)
- **Manifestation:** Never manifests itself except for exceptional reasons
- **What She Offers:** Master of time, initiates the time loop
- **The Cost:** If one soul is saved, one soul must be given for balance. Payment can be collected years later.

### The Cost the Creature Asks
For a god-like creature like the Jellyfish, it does not _feel_ or _understands_ death. What it feels is **imbalance**. It implies this imbalance hurts.
Truly, the imbalance hurts the creature so much that it can't hold the imbalance for more than 15 years. This rule is never explicitely mentionned by the Creature. Only ONE VERY CRYPTIC reference allowed over the whole story.
While the creature suffers, its light is visible in the world.

Paying the cost mechanically allows the time loop to stop.

### Time Loop
The time loop can be any plot that can be justified by a time loop. Try to have simple but creative mechanics. Time loop mechanics must be easily understandable without ANY explicit exposition. The time loop should make Gabriel's story turn into acceptance for his father death through his acceptance of Lucie's death, at least.

## Important Notes for Story Management

### The Love Must Be Real
If readers/players don't believe in Gabriel and Lucie's love, the ending will feel arbitrary. Their relationship must be earned, complex, and genuine.

### The Creature is Not Evil
She is indifferent to human morality. She operates by pure logic. Respect that in her portrayal. She is nature itself—neither good nor bad.

---

## Key Themes

- **Grief and Healing:** Both Gabriel and Lucie carry loss, though they are not at the same stage. Healing comes through connection and love.
- **Acceptance is loss:** In order to get out of the time loop, Gabriel must accept Lucie's death. He loses his old self doing that.
- **Love as a proxy:** Through his love for Lucie, Gabriel accepts death and therefore also makes peace with his father death. Through her love for Gabriel, Lucie finds her true art.
- **Beauty and Danger:** The sea is both beautiful and merciless. Life and death coexist.

## Narrative Guidelines

### Preferred Tone
Melancholic, romantic, introspective, with underlying dread. Breton sensibility—beauty acknowledged alongside danger.

### Pacing
Slow and contemplative. The romance can unfold naturally over weeks/months. The crisis might come suddenly. The timeloop's duration is variable.

### Relationship Depth
The relationship between Gabriel and Lucie can feel real, earned, and profound. Their connection is an emotional anchor, but how deep it goes is emergent.

---

## The Bottom Line

This is a world built for one story: a tragic love story with magical consequences. It is a story about grief, healing, love, and sacrifice. It is a story where the ending cannot be changed, but where every moment leading to it is earned and beautiful.
