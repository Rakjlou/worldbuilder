# Sandy Beach (South of Village)

A wider, more accessible beach south of the village, reachable by stone steps carved into the cliff. Pale sand mixed with dark granite rocks. Shallow enough for swimming in summer (though still cold). Tide pools. Seaweed.

On calm days, it's beautiful and peaceful. On stormy days, it's wild and dangerous. Popular with tourists in peak summer, but quiet most mornings.
