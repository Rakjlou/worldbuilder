# Rocky Cove (North of Gabriel's House)

A small cove accessible via a narrow, treacherous path down the cliff face. Dark granite rocks, smoothed by centuries of Atlantic waves. At high tide, water crashes violently against the stone. At low tide, tidal pools reveal sea life. Seaweed-slicked boulders.

The water is cold, deep, dark green. A natural cave mouth yawns in the cliff face, accessible only at certain tides. This is where Gabriel keeps his small dinghy, moored to a weathered ring bolt.

## Secrets

The cave contains tide pools with bioluminescent creatures—visible on very dark nights.

Old boat wreckage from decades past, mostly buried in sand and stone.

**The cave leads to very deep water.** Old stories say that those who dive deep enough might encounter something beautiful and terrible—a shimmer in the darkness, a jellyfish of light. But most who descend that far never return to tell of it.

## Danger Level

**High** (treacherous path, dangerous tides, deep water)

---

## Notes

Tide times matter here. High tide makes the path treacherous. Low tide opens possibilities. The cave is impassable during high tide.

This is where Gabriel might take Lucie. This is where the story reaches its crisis.
