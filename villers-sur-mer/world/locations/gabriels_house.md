# Gabriel's House (The Sailor's Shrine)

A stone cottage perched on the northern cliff, accessed by a winding path through wild grass and weather-beaten rocks. The house is weathered but solid, with weathered shutters and a small chimney.

Inside, every room is haunted by the ghost of Gabriel's father—sailing maps on the walls, ship's compasses, leather logs from voyages, photographs of a younger man on various vessels. The living room is the heart of this shrine: large windows face the sea, a fireplace holds maritime memories, shelves groan with books about ships and sailing.

## Secrets

A leather journal hidden in the father's bedroom drawer with vivid entries:

> "I descended into the deep and she was there—a shimmer of light, a jellyfish made of stars. I should have drowned, but she held me in that moment. I couldn't breathe but didn't need to."

And later:

> "Did I seek her, or did she call me down? I cannot know."

Evidence that the father spent time at the cliff's edge, perhaps preparing to dive into the deep waters below. Whether he was seeking her or answering her call, the evidence does not clarify.

A painting (unfinished) of a shimmering jellyfish-like shape suspended in deep, dark water, glowing with bioluminescent light. A note on the back: "Did I find you, or did you find me?"

## Rooms

### Living Room
The heart of the house. Large windows facing the sea. Fireplace, bookshelves, sailing charts, ship's compass on mantle, comfortable but worn furniture. Gabriel spends most of his time here.

### Father's Bedroom
Untouched since his death. Bed perfectly made. Wardrobe of his clothes. Personal effects. The journal is here.

### Kitchen
Functional, sparse. Gabriel cooks simply.

### Gabriel's Bedroom
Small, impersonal. He barely sleeps.

### Study
Contains his father's sailing logs and maritime books. Maps everywhere.
